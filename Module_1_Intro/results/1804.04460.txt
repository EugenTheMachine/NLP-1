Abstract—In the practical radar with multiple antennas, the
antenna imperfections degrade the system performance. In this
paper, the problem of estimating the direction of arrival (DOA) in
multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) radar system with
unknown mutual coupling effect between antennas is investi-
gated. To exploit the target sparsity in the spatial domain, the
compressed sensing (CS)-based methods have been proposed by
discretizing the detection area and formulating the dictionary
matrix, so an off-grid gap is caused by the discretization pro-
cesses. In this paper, different from the present DOA estimation
methods, both the off-grid gap due to the sparse sampling and the
unknown mutual coupling effect between antennas are considered
at the same time, and a novel sparse system model for DOA
estimation is formulated. Then, a novel sparse Bayesian learning
(SBL)-based method named sparse Bayesian learning with the
mutual coupling (SBLMC) is proposed, where an expectation-
maximum (EM)-based method is established to estimate all the
unknown parameters including the noise variance, the mutual
coupling vectors, the off-grid vector and the variance vector of
scattering coefficients. Additionally, the prior distributions for all
the unknown parameters are theoretically derived. With regard
to the DOA estimation performance, the proposed SBLMC
method can outperform state-of-the-art methods in the MIMO
radar with unknown mutual coupling effect, while keeping the
acceptable computational complexity.

I. INTRODUCTION

NLIKE the traditional phased-array radar, multiple-input
Ui multiple-output (MIMO) radar systems can transmit
correlated or uncorrelated signals and improve the degree of
freedom, so the recent advancement of radar technology has
directly led to MIMO radar systems. Usually, the MIMO radar
systems can be classified into the colocated radar and dis-
tributed radar. In the colocated MIMO radar, the space between
antennas is comparable with the wavelength of transmitted
signals [1]-[3], such that the waveform diversity can be used

to improve the target estimation performance. In the distributed
MIMO radar, the distances between antennas are significant,
so the spatial diversity of target’s radar cross section (RCS)
provided by the different view-angles of antennas can be used
to improve the target detection performance [4,5]. In general,
the operation of distributed MIMO radar could be challenging
due to the coordination and signal exchange among different
antennas. Therefore, in this paper, a colocated MIMO radar
system is investigated to estimate the directions of arrival
(DOAs) for multiple targets.

Traditionally, the DOA estimation can be achieved based on
the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of the received signal in
the spatial domain [6], but the resolution of such technique is
too low to estimate multiple targets using one beam. The max-
imum likelihood-based and the subspace-based methods have
been proposed to improve the DOA estimation performance,
including multiple signal classification (MUSIC) method [7,8],
Root-MUSIC method [9], and estimating signal parameters
via rotational invariance techniques (ESPRIT) method [10].
Additionally, the beamspace-based methods have also been
proposed for DOA estimation [11]. For example, a beamspace
design method is proposed in [12] for the DOA estimation in
the MIMO radar with colocated antennas; a two-dimensional
joint transmit array interpolation and beamspace design for
planar array mono-static MIMO radar is proposed in [13] for
DOA estimation via tensor modeling; a transmit beamspace
energy focusing method is proposed in [14] for MIMO radar
with application to direction finding. Moreover, a combined
Capon and approximate maximum likelihood (CAML) method
is proposed in [15] for the estimation of target locations and
amplitudes in MIMO radar. The tensor algebra and multidi-
mensional harmonic retrieval are investigated for the DOA
estimation of MIMO radar [16], and an iterative adaptive
Kronecker beamformer for MIMO radar is proposed in [17].
However, in the subspace-based DOA estimation methods,
only the power of received signals from targets are exploited
to establish the target and noise subspaces.

To exploit the target sparsity in the spatial domain, com-
pressed sensing (CS)-based methods are utilized to estimate
DOA [18]-[25]. For example, in [11], an iterative adaptive
approach (IAA), maximum likelihood-based IAA ([AA-ML)
and multi-snapshot sparse Bayesian learning (M-SBL) are
given for the beamforming design based on the sparsity. The
Bayesian approach together with expectation-maximization
(EM) is used in M-SBL to realize the user parameter-free
/n/nACCEPTED BY IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING

method. In [26], both the SBL and the relevance vector
machine (RVM) are proposed, and the sparse reconstruction
theory based on SBL is developed. In [27], Bayesian com-
pressive sensing (BCS) is developed for the sparse signal
reconstruction with the CS measurements. In the CS-based
method, the DOA estimation performance can be improved
by the dense sampling grids. However, both the computational
complexity and the mutual coherence between the columns
in the dictionary are increased by the dense sampling grids.
To improve the DOA estimation performance without the
dense sampling grids, the off-grid DOA estimation method
is proposed in [28]. To further improve the sparse estimation
performance, an off-grid sparse Bayesian inference (OGSBI)
method is first proposed in [29] for the DOA estimation. Then,
by solving a specific polynomial in the off-grid DOA esti-
mation problem, a Root-SBL method with low computational
complexity is proposed in [30]. In [31], the perturbed SBL-
based algorithm is proposed for the DOA estimation. A dic-
tionary learning algorithm for off-grid sparse reconstruction is
proposed in [32]. In [33], a grid evolution method is proposed
to refine the grids for the SBL-based DOA estimation.

However, in the practical MIMO radar system, the mutual
coupling effect between antennas cannot be ignored [34,35].
Therefore, the DOA estimation methods with the unknown
mutual coupling effect have been proposed [36]-[38]. Usu-
ally, the mutual coupling effects among the antennas can
be characterized by a mutual coupling matrix, which is a
symmetric Toeplitz matrix [39]-[41]. However, in the present
papers, the effects of both off-grid in the CS-based method
and the mutual coupling among antennas have not been
considered simultaneously, especially, for the methods based
on the Bayesian theory.

In this paper, the DOA estimation problem in the MIMO
radar system with unknown mutual coupling effect is inves-
tigated. Different from the present methods, a novel sparse-
based system model considering both the off-grid gap and
the unknown mutual coupling effect is formulated. Then, a
novel estimation method named SBL with the mutual cou-
pling (SBLMC) is proposed, where an EM-based method is
established to iteratively estimate all the unknown parameters
including the noise variance, the mutual coupling vectors, the
off-grid vector and the variance vector of scattering coeffi-
cients. Additionally, we theoretically derive the prior distri-
butions for all the unknown parameters including the target
scattering coefficients, the mutual coupling vectors, the off-
grid vector and the noise variance. Then, the proposed SBLMC
is compared with state-of-the-art methods. To summarize, we
make the contributions as follows:

¢ The Sparse-based model for MIMO radar with un-

known mutual coupling effect: Considering both the
off-grid effect and mutual coupling effect, a novel system
model of MIMO radar is formulated by exploiting the

Il. MIMO RADAR MODEL FOR DOA ESTIMATION

As shown in Fig. 1, we consider a colocated MIMO radar
system, where M transmitting antennas and N receiving an-
tennas are adopted. In the MIMO radar system, the orthogonal
signals are transmitted by the antennas, and the waveform in
the m-th (m = 0,1,...,—1) transmitting antenna is s,,,(t).
Assuming that /¢ far-field point targets in the same range cell
are detected, we will consider the DOA estimation problem
for these targets. The angle of the k-th (k = 0,1,...,& —1)

target is denoted as @;. Therefore, under the assumption
of narrowband signals, the received signals during the p-th
(p = 0,1,...,P —1, and P denotes the number of pulses)
pulse can be expressed as

Using the same method, we can obtain the expression of Cr.

Since the orthogonal signals are adopted in the transmitting
antennas, we can use M/Z matched filters corresponding to the
M orthogonal signals to distinguish the orthogonal signals. We
estimate the parameters of targets at a specific range cell, so
the delays rr and 7p are omitted. Therefore, passing the m-th

where D = [d(0o),d(01),...,d(0—1)]. Therefore, the re-

by the following model

To simplify the formula with the mutual coupling matrix in
(14), we will use the following lemma:

Lemma 1. For complex symmetric Toeplitz matrix A =

have [41]-[43]

where a is a vector formed by the first row of A, and Q =

Then, the received signal in (14) can be rewritten as

A. The Off-Grid Sparse Model

Discretize the angle of detection area into U grids ¢ ©
[Co,¢1,.--,¢v—1], and the u-th discretized angle are denoted
as ¢,. Then, a dictionary matrix can be formulated as

wv A [®(6o), 8(41), i ,B(Gv-1)] € CMNXUMN (1)
where ®(¢,,) = Qy(Gu) @ Qa(Gu), and the space between
discretized angles, also known as grid size, is 6 & Guta — Cul.
For the dictionary matrix W, the restricted isometry property
(RIP) with constant 6,, is defined as [44]

(1-42) llarllo < al|z <(1+de)|el2, G2)

for all w-sparse vector « (~w = KMN). If a is w-sparse
and W satisfies d25 + 632 < 1, then & is the unique ¢)
minimizer [45]. However, the tight RIP constant of a given
matrix W is difficult to compute, so we calculate the minimum
DOA separation for multiple targets. As described in [46], in
our scenario (the system parameters are given in Section IV),
the minimum DOA separation can be obtained as 9.67°.

However, for the k-th target, the DOA is 6; and is not at the
discretized grids exactly, so the sub-matrix for the k-th target
can be approximated by

ceived signal R, we can estimate the target DOAs 6; (k =

sparse matrix X, the off-grid vector v, and the mutual
coupling vectors cr and cr. The DOAs can be obtained from
the support sets of X, the target scattering coefficients are
obtained from the nonzero entries of X, and the mutual
coupling matrices can be obtained from cy and cp.

B. Sparse Bayesian Learning-Based DOA Estimation Method

In this paper, we propose an SBL-based method to estimate
the target DOAs with unknown mutual coupling effect, and
the proposed method is named as SBL with the mutual
coupling (SBLMC). The graphical model of SBLMC is given
in Fig. 2, where the unknown parameters are determined by the
hyperparameters, and the received signal S' is determined by
radar parameters and signals. To realize the SBLMC algorithm,
the distribution assumptions are given as follows.

We assume that the additive noise is white (circularly
symmetric) Gaussian noise with the noise variance being 02,
and the distribution of noise can be expressed as

U-1

p(N\o;,) = Il CN(n)|0mnx1.%,2un), (39)
u=0
where the complex Gaussian distribution is defined as
1 Hy-1
,d) = =e (ea) 40
CN (#\a,®) = Taree (40)

2 is unknown, by defining a

When the noise variance o7,
hyperparamter, i.e., the precision, An 4 Oo, 2. a Gamma
distribution can be adopted to describe the inverse of noise

variance

P(Qn) = (An; a, 6), (41)

where a and b are the hyperparameters for a,, and
G(an;a,b) Tol (a)btae bene | (42)
T(a) 4 [ a te-"dx. (43)

Note that the Gamma distribution a, ~ G6(an;a,b) is a
conjugate prior of the Gaussian distribution given mean with
unknown variance x ~ N‘(2|0,a;,1), so the posterior distri-
bution p(a,,|z) also follows a Gamma distribution. Therefore,
the assumption of Gamma distribution for the precision a,»
can simplify the following analysis.

When the scattering coefficients I are independent among
snapshots, we can also assume that the sparse matrix X
follows a Gaussian distribution

P-1
P(X|Ae) = [] CN (ap|Ovx1, Ax),

p=0

(44)

where A,, € RY*Y is a diagonal matrix with the u-th diagonal
entry being Oo Usually, the sparseness prior is the Laplace
density function [26,27], but the Laplace prior is not conjugate
to the Gaussian likelihood. Therefore, for simplification, we
use the Gaussian prior for the sparse matrix X and obtain the
estimation expressions in closed form. Then, by defining the

precision B = [Bo, Bi... ,Bu-i]" and 8, = o72, we have
the following Gamma prior for 3
U-1

(45)

p(B;¢,4) = T[ 6(Bus6,4),
u=0

where c and d are the hyperparmaters for 3.

Similarly, when the mutual coupling coefficients are inde-
pendent with antennas, we can also assume that the mutual
coupling vectors cr and cr follow Gaussian distributions

where both e; and f; are the hyperparameters for Yr, and
both e2 and f2 are the hyperparameters for 0p. Usually, we
can choose the following values a= b=c=d=e, = fi =

= f2 = 10~? as the hyperparameters. As shown in [26], the
small values for hyperparameters are chosen and not sensitive
to specific values [47].

The off-grid parameter v follows a uniform prior distribu-
tion, and the distribution of the u-th entry 1, can be expressed

as
1.1
D(Vu;5) = Un, ([-36 |) ; (50)
where we have
a <a<b
Up ([a,b]) £4 Re STS 0 51
([a,6)) { otherwise GD)

The relationships between parameters are shown in Fig. 2.
To estimate the DOAs, we can formulate the following prob-
lem to maximize the posterior probability with the received
signal

& = arg max p(|F), (52)
where we use a set X 4 {X, V, Cr, CR, o BS to contain all
the unknown parameters. However, the problem of posterior
probability cannot be solved directly, so an EM method is
adopted to realize the sparse Bayesian learning.

To obtain the posterior distribution of X, we first calculate
the joint distribution for all the parameters

p(R, X) = p(R|X)p(X|B)p(er|9r)p(er|Ir)P(an)

P(B)p(9r)p(Or)p(v). (53)

Therefore, with the parameters a,,, 3, Ur, Vp, V, Cr and Cr,
the posterior for X can be obtained as

p(X|R,v, cr, cr, An, 8, Or, OR)
p(R, X)
p(R, Vv, cr, cr, An, 3, Or, OR)
p(R|X)p(X |B)
p(R\v, cr, CR, An, B, Or, OR)’

where p(R|X) and (X|) can be calculated as

Since the denominator in (54) is not a function of X, the
posterior distribution of X can be simplified as
p(X|R, v, cr, CR, An, B, Or, OR) x p(R\X)p(X |B). (57)

Both p(R|X) and p(X|G) are Gaussian functions, so the
posterior for X can be also expressed as a Gaussian function

and we use /p,, to denote the u-th entry of y.,.

To calculate Xx and ps, we need to estimate the mu-
tual coupling vectors cr and cp, the off-grid parameter
vy, and the precisions a, and @. We can use the max-
imum posterior probability (MAP) method to maximize
DV, Cr, CR, An, B, OT, OR|R). We have

P(V, Cr, CR, An, B, Or, OR|R)p(R)

= PV, Cr, Cr, On, B, Vr, OR, R), (61)
so maximizing p(Vv, cr, cr, An, 3, Ur, YR|R) is equivalent to
maximizing p(v, cr, cr, An, 3,07, Or, R). The EM method
can be used to solve the MAP estimation by treating X as
a hidden variable. Before estimating the parameters, we will

In Algorithm 1, we show the details about the proposed
method SBLMC to estimate the DOAs with unknown mutual
coupling effect. In the proposed SBLMC algorithm, after the
iterations, we can obtain the spatial spectrum Px of the sparse
matrix X from the received signal R. Then, by searching all
the values of Px, the corresponding peak values can be found.
By selecting positions of peak values corresponding to the
maximum values, we can estimate the DOAs of targets, where
we use ¢ + vas the discretized angle vector.

IV. SIMULATION RESULTS

In this section, the simulation results about the proposed
method for DOA estimation in the MIMO radar system are
given, and the simulation parameters are given in Table I.
For the proposed SBLMC algorithm, the maximum iteration
is Niter = 10° and the stop threshold is 4 = 1073. All
experiments are carried out in Matlab R2017b on a PC with
a 2.9 GHz Intel Core iS and 8 GB of RAM. Matlab codes
have been made available online at https://sites.google.com/
site/chenpengdsp/publications.

First, we show the estimated spatial spectrum of 3 targets.
As shown in Fig. 3, 3 present methods including off-grid
sparse Bayesian inference (OGSBI) [29], Bayesian compres-
sive sensing (BCS) [27] and MUSIC [8], have compared
with the proposed SBLMC method. With the mutual coupling
effect, the traditional MUSIC method cannot achieve better

performance. Since the present Bayesian methods (OGSBI
and BCS) have not considered the mutual coupling effect,
the estimation performance cannot be further improved. The
proposed SBLMC considers both off-grid and mutual coupling
effects, can achieve the best spatial spectrum and improve
the DOA estimation performance. In Table II, we give the
estimated DOAs with different methods. We use the following
expression to measure the estimation performance

€ © 10 logy | — 4l|3 (4B), (90)
where 6 denotes the estimated DOA vector and @ is the target
DOA vector. Both @ and @ are in rad. The estimation errors of
OGSBI, BCS and MUSIC methods are —25.20 dB, —26.78 dB
and —28.94 dB, respectively. Since the mutual coupling effect
has not been considered, the DOA estimation performance of
/n/nACCEPTED BY IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING

these 3 present methods almost the same. However, the DOA
estimation error of the proposed SBLMC is —49.31 dB, which
is significantly better than the present methods.

Additionally, the DOA estimation performance of the pro-
posed SBLMC method is compared with present methods in
Fig. 4. The CS-based method (L1 norm) is proposed in [24,48],
where the DOA estimation problem is converted into a sparse
reconstruction problem via ¢; minimization. The MUSIC-
like method is proposed in [41], where the mutual coupling
effect is considered in the MUSIC-like method. The Capon-
like is proposed in [15] for the DOA estimation in MIMO
radar systems. As shown in this figure, the proposed method
achieves the best DOA estimation performance in the scenario
with unknown mutual coupling effect by estimating all the
unknown parameters iteratively in the SBL-based method.
However, the disadvantage of the proposed method is higher
computational complexity than these present methods.

We also show the DOA estimation performance with differ-
ent signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) in Fig. 5. As shown in this
figure, when SNR < —10 dB, all the methods cannot work
well, and the performance is almost the same. When SNR >
—10 dB, the DOA estimation performance of present methods
including OGSBI, BCS and MUSIC cannot be improved,
and the estimation errors are around —28 dB. However, with
improving SNR, the estimation performance of SBLMC can
also be improved, and the final estimation error can be lower
than —50 dB with SNR > 5 dB. With the Cramér-Rao lower
bound (CRLB) in [49], Fig. 5 also shows the corresponding
CRLB of DOA estimation. As shown in this figure, when
SNR > 5 dB, the proposed method can approach CRLB.
In Fig. 5, the curve “SBLMC (2°)” is the SBLMC method
with the grid size being 6 = 2° and the curve “SBLMC (1°)”
is that with the grid size being 5 = 1°. From the curves,
we can see that the estimation performance of SBLMC can
approach the CRLB with the dense sampling grids (6 = 1°).
Therefore, the reason why the estimation error cannot be
further reduced (error floor) is that the spatial spectrum is
discretized to find the peak values and the discretized grids
cannot be infinitely small. The proposed SBLMC method can
improve the estimation performance, but the improvement is
limited by the grid size.

Then, we also show the mutual coupling effect on the DOA
estimation in Fig. 6, where the mutual coupling effect between
adjacent antennas is from —15 dB to —2 dB. With increasing
the mutual coupling effect, the DOA estimation error of BCS
is from —34 dB to —28 dB. Since the grid effect in the BCS
method, decreasing the mutual coupling effect cannot further
improve the estimation performance when the mutual coupling
between adjacent antennas is less than —8 dB. However, for
both OGSBI and MUSIC methods, decreasing the mutual
coupling effect can decrease the estimation error from around
—25 dB to around —50 dB. For the proposed methods, since
the mutual coupling vectors ce; and cp are estimated, the
mutual coupling has limited effect on the DOA estimation
performance, and the estimation error can be lower than —50
dB when the mutual coupling between adjacent antennas is
less than —2 dB.

We show the DOA estimation performance with different

grid sizes in Fig. 7, where the space between adjacent dis-
cretized angles 5 is from 2° to 10°. Since the BCS method
has not considered the off-grid effect, the worst estimation
performance is achieved in these 3 methods. Both BCS and
OGSBI methods have not considered the mutual coupling, so
when the grid size 6 is less than 6°, the estimation performance
cannot be improved. However, for the proposed SBLMC, with
decreasing the gird size 6 from 10° to 2°, the estimation error
can be decreased from —8 dB to —50 dB.

Finally, we compare the computational time of the pro-
posed SBLMC method with that of the present 3 methods in
Table III. All the methods have not been further optimized
to decrease the computational time. Without the additional
simplifications, the computational complexities of SBLMC in
Step 5, Step 8 and Step 10 are O(PU?7MN+UM?N?+U%),
O(PU2MN + UM?N? + U*) and O(U? + PU?MN), so
the computational complexities of SBLMC can be obtained
as O(U? + PU?MN + UM?N7%) per iteration and an ad-
ditional computational workload of order O(U?M?N?*) for
initialization. To simplify the representation, with U > MN,
the computational complexity of SBLMC can be approximated
by O(PU®). If U < MN the computational complexity of
SBLMC can be approximated by O(PUM?N?). Therefore,
the proposed SBLMC algorithm has the same order of compu-
tational complexity with OGSBI [29]. Since MUSIC algorithm
is a continue domain method, we estimate the target DOAs
by discretizing the detection range [—80°, 80°] into 1.6 x 10°
grids. As shown in this table, the BCS method is the fastest
among all methods, since the detection angle is discretized by
5 = 2°. The proposed SBLMC is comparable with the OGSBI
method, but the DOA estimation performance is much better.
The computational time of MUSIC method is determined by
the length of discretized angles, and usually is a method
with higher computational complexity than BCS. Therefore,
the proposed SBLMC method can significantly improve the
estimation performance in the MIMO radar system with both
off-grid and mutual coupling effects with the acceptable com-
putational complexity.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have investigated the DOA estimation problem in
MIMO radar system with unknown mutual coupling effect
in this paper. The off-grid problem in the CS-based sparse
reconstruction method has also been considered concurrently
to improve the DOA estimation performance. The novel sparse
Bayesian learning with mutual coupling (SBLMC) method
using EM has been proposed to estimate target DOAs. Ad-
ditionally, we have theoretically derived the prior distributions

confirm that the proposed SBLMC method outperforms the
present DOA estimation methods in the MIMO radar sys-
tem with the unknown mutual coupling effect. Additionally,
the computational complexity of SBLMC is also acceptable.
However, with the same characteristic of the sparse-based
super-resolution methods, the minimum DOA separation of
the proposed SBLMC method is limited by the radar aperture.
Future work will focus on the optimization of MIMO radar
system using the SBLMC method for DOA estimation.
