ABSTRACT

We report the detection of CO(1-0) emission from NGC 1277, a lenticular galaxy in
he Perseus Cluster. NGC 1277 has previously been proposed to host an overmassive
black hole (BH) compared to the galaxy bulge luminosity (mass), based on stellar-
inematic measurements. The CO(1-0) emission, observed with the IRAM Plateau de
Bure Interferometer (PdBI) using both, a more compact (2.9-arcsec resolution) and
a more extended (l-arcsec resolution) configuration, is likely to originate from the
dust lane encompassing the galaxy nucleus at a distance of 0.9 arcsec (~ 320 pc).
The double-horned CO(1-0) profile found at 2.9-arcsec resolution traces 1.5 x 10° Mo
of molecular gas, likely orbiting in the dust lane at ~ 550 km s~', which suggests a
otal enclosed mass of ~ 2 x 10!° Mo. At L-arcsec resolution, the CO(1-0) emission
appears spatially resolved along the dust lane in east-west direction, though at a low
signal-to-noise ratio. In agreement with the previous stellar-kinematic measurements,
he CO(1-0) kinematics is found to be consistent with an ~ 1.7 x 10! Mo BH for a
stellar mass-to-light ratio of M/Ly = 6.3, while a less massive BH of ~ 5 x 10° Mo
is possible when assuming a larger M/Ly = 10. While the molecular gas reservoir
may be associated with a low level of star formation activity, the extended 2.6-mm
continuum emission is likely to originate from a weak AGN, possibly characterized
by an inverted radio-to-millimetre spectral energy distribution. Literature radio and
X-ray data indicate that the BH in NGC 1277 is also overmassive with respect to the
Fundamental Plane of BH activity.

INTRODUCTION by AGN feedback (e.g. Silk & Rees 1998; Di Matteo et al.
2005). However, the implicit build-up of scaling relations
in the course of hierarchical merging, as proposed by Peng
(2007) and Jahnke & Maccid (2011), may play a role as
well. A more complex picture involving self-regulatory and
non-causal processes may be required to explain the var-
ious aspects of the observed BH-galaxy correlations (see
Kormendy & Ho 2013, for a recent review).

The discovery of scaling relations between supermas-
sive black holes (BHs) and their host galaxies has
~~ been a major observational result in the field of galaxy
evolution over the last ~15-20 yr. Scaling relations
have been found between the mass of the supermas-
sive BH and the stellar velocity dispersion of the host
galaxy bulge (Mpu-o relation), the bulge luminosity

(Mpu-Lspn relation), and bulge mass (Mpu-Mspn_ rela-
tion), (e.g. Magorrian et al. 1998; Ferrarese & Merritt 2000;
Gebhardt et al. 2000; Marconi & Hunt 2003; Haring & Rix
2004; Giiltekin et al. 2009a; Graham et al. 2011; Sani et al.
2011; McConnell & Ma 2013). These empirical scaling re-
lations have been interpreted as a sign of co-evolution be-
tween supermassive BHs and their host galaxies, mediated

Outliers from the BH scaling relations are of particu-
ar interest for the purpose of testing and interpreting these
relations. Larger sample sizes of galaxies with reliable mea-
surements of BH and galaxy parameters have recently led
to refined analyses, by which it has been possible to rec-
oncile some of the previous outliers with the BH relations.
Barred galaxies have been found to deviate from the Mgu-o
relation of non-barred galaxies, explaining some of the out-
iers with under-massive BHs (e.g. Graham 2008). Similarly,
ased on a classification into ‘classical’ bulges (formed by

/n/n2 J. Scharwéchter et al.

mergers) and ‘pseudo’-bulges (dominated by secular evolu-
tion and related to bars), Kormendy et al. (2011) have iden-
tified ‘pseudo’-bulges as outliers from the relations. Graham
(2012) and Graham & Scott (2013) have recently proposed
that the location of galaxies in the Mpu-Mspn plane can be
interpreted as a bent relation, resulting from the superposi-
tion of two different relations for galaxies with ‘Sérsic’ and
‘core-Sérsic’ spheroids in the low- and high-mass regime, re-
spectively. ‘Core-Sérsic’ spheroids, which are typically more
massive and thought to be dominated by dry mergers, fol-
low a nearly log-linear Mpu-Mgpn relation, while ‘Sérsic’
spheroids, which are thought to be dominated by rapid
BH growth in gas-rich processes, follow a steeper, almost
quadratic relation at BH masses below ~ (2—10) x 10° Mo.
Some low-redshift AGN with apparently under-massive BHs
(e.g. Mathur et al. 2012; Busch et al. 2014) could be repre-
sentatives of this near-quadratic relation (Graham & Scott
2015).

At the high-mass end, the BH scaling relations have
recently been challenged by a number of galaxies hosting
ultramassive BHs of the order of 10'°Mo, the largest BH
masses known to date. Ultramassive BHs are likely to pro-
vide new insights into galaxy and BH growth, as they must
have experienced the strongest growth over time. Ultramas-
sive BHs seem to typically be associated with central mas-
sive galaxies in clusters. Two such galaxies, NGC 4889 and
NGC 3842, have measured BH masses of 2.1*}'§ x 10° Mo
and 9.7732 x 10° Mo, respectively (McConnell et al. 2011,
2012) and further indirect arguments suggest a similar asso-
ciation (Hlavacek-Larrondo et al. 2012). Ultramassive BHs
seem to show a tendency to be overmassive compared to
the Mgu-o relation, while they are still largely in agreement
with the Mpu-Mgpn relation (cf. McConnell & Ma 2013).
This deviation could indicate that the growth of the cen-
tral galaxies in clusters has had a significant contribution
from dry mergers, which tend to increase velocity disper-
sion more than stellar mass (Volonteri & Ciotti 2013). How-
ever, the dry-merger scenario is observationally controversial
(Savorgnan & Graham 2015).

An extreme case for an ultramassive BH is NGC 1277,
which is not a Brightest Cluster Galaxy, but a 1.2x10'! Mo
compact SO galaxy in the core of the Perseus Cluster,
about 3.8 arcmin away from the Brightest Cluster Galaxy
NGC 1275 (van den Bosch et al. 2012). A number of re-
cent studies have analysed the BH mass in NGC 1277
based on stellar kinematics. The first measurement was
published by van den Bosch et al. (2012), who found a BH
mass of (1.7 + 0.3) x 10!° Mo, using Schwarzschild mod-
els for the long-slit stellar kinematics and input photometry
from multi-Gaussian expansion of a Hubble Space Telescope
(HST) image. The measurement by Yildirim et al. (2015)
has resulted in a marginally smaller best-fitting BH mass of
1.3 x 10'° Mo, but, otherwise, in a good general agreement
with the van den Bosch et al. (2012) results. Most recently,
Walsh et al. (2016) have presented a revised BH mass of
(4.9 + 1.6) x 10° Mo, based on stellar-kinematic data at
higher spatial resolution than used in the previous studies.
van den Bosch et al. (2012) report an extreme BH-to-stellar
mass ratio, with a BH mass amounting to 59 per cent of
the bulge mass or 14 per cent of the total stellar mass of
NGC 1277. Even with the latest BH mass measurement of
(4.9 £ 1.6) x 10° Mo, the BH in NGC 1277 is overmassive

compared to the K-band Mpu-Lspn relation (Walsh et al.
2016).

NGC 1277 could have lost a fraction of its stel-
lar mass by tidal stripping in the cluster environment,
which could explain why the BH is overmassive. How-
ever, van den Bosch et al. (2012) find no strong indica-
tions that would suggest that NGC 1277 has been af-
fected by tidal stripping. Optical spectra suggest that
the stellar population of NGC 1277 is uniformly old (~
10 Gyr), and the galaxy shows no obvious signs of in-
teractions (van den Bosch et al. 2012; Trujillo et al. 2014;
Martin-Navarro et al. 2015). NGC 1277 has been discussed
as a local example of a ‘relic’ galaxy, which has not un-
dergone any significant transformations in its recent evo-
lution and shows a stellar mass density profile similar to
the ones found for massive compact high-redshift galaxies
(Trujillo et al. 2014; Ferré-Mateu et al. 2015).

The overmassive BH in NGC 1277 has possibly been in

place since this last violent star formation episode, because
significant BH accretion without coeval star formation is un-
likely (van den Bosch et al. 2012). By analysing an X-ray
Chandra spectrum of NGC 1277, Fabian et al. (2013) find
evidence of a power-law from an unresolved central point
source with a 0.5-7 keV luminosity of 1.3x 10*° erg s-! (cor-
rected for absorption) and extended thermal gas. NGC 1277
has also been reported to be associated with an unresolved
radio continuum detection with fluxes of 2.85 and 1.6 mJy
at 1.4 and 5 GHz, respectively (Sijbring 1993). Fabian et al.
(2013) argue that the current growth rate of the BH is likely
to be negligible and that radiatively efficient Bondi accre-
tion on to such a massive BH would suggest a 5-6 orders of
magnitude larger luminosity of the X-ray power-law source
than observed. The small current growth rate is surprising
because the X-ray properties of NGC 1277 are characteristic
of minicoronae and the corona lies within the Bondi radius
(Sun et al. 2007; Fabian et al. 2013).
n view of the extreme properties of NGC 1277,
Fabian et al. (2013) have proposed an evolutionary scenario
based on the assumption that ultramassive BHs acquired
the bulk of their mass at high redshift, where the most mas-
sive haloes could grow BHs rapidly. This rapid BH growth
would most likely have involved extreme AGN feedback,
shutting down new star formation. By z = 3, ultramas-
sive BHs are then likely to be hosted in compact red bulges
with a passive stellar population. Fabian et al. (2013) sug-
gest that the further evolution of these host bulges de-
pends on whether they are able to accrete external gas and
stars. Galaxies like NGC 1277, moving at high velocity in a
cluster core, may have remained virtually unchanged since
z = 3, whilst Brightest Cluster Galaxies, centred in the
cluster potential well, may have continued to grow signifi-
cantly. Graham & Scott (2015) point out that the location of
NGC 1277 in the Mgu-Mspn plane overlaps with an extrapo-
lation of the near-quadratic relation for ‘Sérsic’ spheroids to
high masses, where the plane is typically populated by ‘core-
Sérsic’ spheroids. In this interpretation, NGC 1277 could be
a rare example of a galaxy in which growth by gas-rich pro-
cesses has continued on a near-quadratic relation instead of
being terminated at the typical break mass. This scenario,
however, is more difficult to reconcile with the small present
growth rate of the BH in NGC 1277 and the predominantly
old stellar population.

/n/nThe first BH mass measurement for NGC 1277 by
van den Bosch et al. (2012), which resulted in (1.7 + 0.3) x
10'° Mo, has been controversial. Emsellem (2013) argues
that this large value for the BH mass is mostly determined
by the fit to the central part of the measured Gauss-Hermite
ha profile, so that the accuracy of this parameter is criti-
cal. The N-body realizations presented by Emsellem (2013)
show that a smaller BH mass of 5 x 10° Mo provides a good
fit to the stellar kinematics, except for a small discrepancy
in the Gauss-Hermite ha parameter. According to Emsellem
(2013), an even smaller BH mass is possible, if variations in
the mass-to-light ratio or high-velocity stars in the central
region are present. These N-body realizations are based on a
new multi-Gaussian expansion of the HST photometry and
on the assumption that the potential is defined by a constant
mass-to-light ratio of M/Ly = 10 without any dark mat-
ter halo. As an alternative scenario, Emsellem (2013) also
demonstrates that an end-on view on an inner bar together
with a BH of only 2.5 x 10° Mo can reproduce the stel-
lar kinematics, except for the central part of the ha profile.
The smaller BH mass of 5 x 10° Mo suggested by Emsellem
(2013) is consistent with the most recent measurement of
(4.9 + 1.6) x 10° Mo reported by Walsh et al. (2016) based
on stellar kinematic data at high spatial resolution.

An independent constraint on the BH mass of
NGC 1277 can be obtained by using gas kinematics as a
tracer of the gravitational potential (e.g. Davis et al. 2013;
Davis 2014; Onishi et al. 2015). In this paper, we report
the first detection of CO(1-0) emission from the centre of
NGC 1277, based on observations with the IRAM PdBI. We
interpret the CO(1-0) and 2.6-mm continuum data with the
help of an optical image, obtained from archival HST data,
and discuss implications for the BH mass of NGC 1277. The
observations and data reduction of the IRAM and ancil-
lary data are described in Section 2. The results obtained
for the CO(1-0) and 2.6-mm continuum emission are pre-
sented in Section 3. In Section 4, we interpret the origin
of the molecular gas and continuum detections, derive con-
straints for the enclosed mass from the molecular gas kine-
matics, and discuss star formation in the molecular gas as
well as BH accretion scenarios. We summarize the main re-
sults in Section 5 and conclude with notes on the role of
NGC 1277 in BH and galaxy growth scenarios. Throughout
the paper, we will assume a scale of 353 pc arcsec”' and
a luminosity distance modulus of 34.39 (i.e. a luminosity
distance of 75.5 Mpc), consistent with the values used by
van den Bosch et al. (2012).

2 OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION
2.1 IRAM PdBI data

The millimetre data for NGC 1277 were obtained using the
IRAM PdBI in both, a more extended and a more com-
pact configuration, providing spatial resolutions of ~ 1 arc-
sec and ~ 2.9 arcsec, respectively. A list of all observa-
tions, indicating the number of antennas, the minimum and
maximum baselines, and the calibrators, is provided in Ta-
ble 1. In order to observe the redshifted CO(1-0) line in
NGC 1277, the dual-polarization receiver in the 3-mm band
was tuned to 113.356 GHz, according to the optical sys-
temic velocity of NGC 1277 of 5066 kms~! (Falco et al.

MNRAS 000, 1-15 (0000)

The overmassive black hole in NGC 1277 3

1999). We verified the systemic velocity based on stellar
absorption lines (Car A2.26 wm, MgI A2.28 pm, and CO
bandheads at about 2.29, 2.32, and 2.35 jm) in a sin-
gle nuclear-aperture K-band spectrum of NGC 1277, ex-
tracted from a subset of archival NIFS (Gemini North) data
from programme GN-2011B-Q-27 (PI: D. Richstone), (see
Walsh et al. 2016). The systemic velocity derived from fit-
ting this spectrum with template stars from the NIFS spec-
tral template library v2.0 (Winge et al. 2009) using PPXF
(Cappellari & Emsellem 2004) agrees within ~ 20 km s~*
with the value of 5066 km s~'. Since an offset of this or-
der of magnitude is negligible compared to the accuracy at
which the CO(1-0) data are analysed, we will present the
CO(1-0) data using the reference velocity of 5066 km s~'.

The PdBI observations of NGC 1277 were performed
using the Wide-Band correlator WideX, which provides a
spectral resolution of 1.95 MHz and a bandwidth of 3.6 GHz
covering the CO(1-0) line as well as the adjacent 2.6-mm
continuum. The J2000 coordinates R.A. = 03h 19m 51.5s
and Dec = +41° 34’ 24''7 were used as pointing reference.
The data for both configurations were reduced using the
IRAM GILDAS software CLIC and MAPPING.

2.1.1 Observations at low spatial resolution

The observations in the more compact configuration (special
CD configuration, including the new seventh antenna) — ob-
tained between 2014 December 16 and 2015 July 6 — cover
baselines between 24 and 176 m and a total on-source time of
9.38 h for seven antennas. The details of these observations
are listed in Table 1. The phase and amplitude calibration
was performed based on 3C 84 and quasar 0300+470. Ei-
ther MWC 349 or LKHA 101 were used as flux calibrators,
while 0059+581, 3C 454.3, or 3C 84 were used as RF calibra-
tors. The RF calibration based on 3C 84 could be affected
by CO(1-0) emission from 3C 84. This calibrator was nev-
ertheless chosen for the observations on 2015 February 19,
because no obvious contamination was found and because
the calibration was improved by using this strong calibrator
instead of the weaker alternatives. The final UV table was
created by merging the data from all observing dates using
a spectral resolution of 40 MHz (105.8 km s~').

The UV table was mapped using 256 x 256 spatial
pixels, natural weighting, no tapering, and a pixel size of
0.61 x 0.61 arcsec”. The data cube was cleaned by apply-
ing Hégbom deconvolution (Hégbom 1974) to each spa-
tial plane. The deconvolution was performed with a prede-
fined support covering the emission that is evident in each
channel close to the reference position of NGC 1277. The
resulting beam size is 2.96 x 2.78 arcsec”. The lo noise
level per 40-MHz channel in the cleaned cube is found
to be 0.36 mJy beam~! at 6000 km s~' and increases to
0.62 mJy beam~! at —3400 km s~! with a value of about
0.47 mJy beam~' around the NGC 1277 reference velocity.
The continuum was subtracted from the cleaned data cube
by subtracting the average of all channels close to the line
emission but excluding the velocity range of the line itself.
A number of the highest and lowest velocity channels were
not considered when computing the continuum, since they
show indications of unidentified features or noise peaks.

2.1.2 Observations at high spatial resolution

In the more extended configuration (B configuration), NGC
1277 was observed on 2014 March 12 and 14, respectively
(see Table 1). These observations cover baselines between
88 and 452 m and a total on-source time of 8.29 h with
six antennas. The phase and amplitude calibration for both
observing dates was derived from observations of 3C 84
and quasar 0307+380. The flux is based on 0307+380 or
MWC 349, while 3C 273 or 2013+370 were used as RF cal-
ibrators. The final UV table was created by merging the
data from both observing dates using a spectral resolution
of 40 MHz or 105.8 km s~?.

The UV table was converted into a data cube by map-
ping the data spatially on to 512 x 512 pixels using natural
weighting, no tapering, and a pixel size of 0.24 x 0.24 arcsec”.
The data cube was cleaned using the same method as ap-
plied to the low-resolution data. The resulting beam size in
this more extended configuration is 1.15 x 0.86 arcsec”. The
lo noise level per 40-MHz channel in the cleaned cube in-
creases with decreasing velocity from about 0.3 mJy beam™!
at 6000 km s~' to 0.6 mJy beam™' at —3400 km s~' with a
value of 0.42 mJy beam™~! around the NGC 1277 reference
velocity.

Since the CO(1-0) emission in this data set is weak, a
blind detection assessment was performed on the cleane:
data cube, both before and after continuum subtraction,
using a wrapper around SEXTRACTOR (Bertin & Arnouts
1996). For each channel in the cube, a narrow-band im-
age was created by averaging over a predefined number o:
neighbouring channels. In order to account for different line
widths, the channel average was varied between a single
channel and the maximum range of channels, using only odd
numbers for a symmetric average around the central channel.
Each narrow-band image was sent to SEXTRACTOR in order
to identify all groups of pixels with values above a certain
detection threshold. Both, the detection threshold as well
as the minimum area covered by pixels above this thresh-
old, are user-defined input parameters of SEXTRACTOR. In
order to improve the detection process, we applied the SEX-
TRACTOR image filtering before detection, using a Gaussian
convolution kernel with an FWHM of 4 pixels (0.96 arcsec),
which roughly matches the beam size.

The detection assessment of the full data cube using
single-channel narrow-band images, a SEXTRACTOR detec-
tion threshold of 30, and a minimum detection area of 3 pix-
els, results in the detection of a continuum emission peak at a
mean offset of AR.A. = —0.15 arcsec and ADec = 0.18 arc-
sec for most channels across the full frequency range. In

order to isolate weak line emission, a continuum subtraction
was performed using the same method as applied to the low-
resolution data. The resulting continuum image has a lo
background noise level of 0.089 mJy beam~'. A new detec-
tion assessment was performed on the continuum-subtracted
data cube, using a detection threshold of 2o and a minimum
detection area of 1 pixel to detect faint features. Within
a distance of 13 arcsec around the reference position, only
one detection is identified at a > 50 (peak flux over back-
ground rms) level. This detection at ~ 5.lo is found at
AR.A. = 0.48 arcsec and ADec = 0.17 arcsec from the
reference position when averaging 3 channels (320 km s')
around a central velocity of +530 km s~'. While this detec-
tion is rather marginal based on the blind assessment, we
will show in Sect. 3.3 that this feature is clearly confirmed
as CO(1-0) emission from NGC 1277 by comparison with
the data obtained at lower spatial resolution.

2.2 Ancillary optical data

Ancillary archival data from HST observations in the
F550M filter are used to compare the millimetre observa-
tions with the optical features of NGC 1277. The optical
HST image has already been presented by other authors to
discuss the morphology of NGC 1277 (van den Bosch et al.
2012; Emsellem 2013; Fabian et al. 2013; Trujillo et al.
2014). We found the World Coordinate System (WCS) of
the archival HS'T image to be offset, which we corrected by
comparing the positions of objects in a ~ 45 x 45 arcsec”
cut-out around NGC 1277 to coordinates from the Guide
Star Catalog (GSC) 2.3 (Lasker et al. 2008). Four of these
objects, extracted using the IMSTAR routine included in
the WCSTOOLS package (e.g. Mink 1997), were found to
match catalogued sources. Based on these, a new plate so-
lution was derived using the IRAF! task CCMAP with a
second-order polynomial fit. The fit shows an rms of about
0.2 arcsec, which is a similar order of magnitude as the aver-
age absolute astrometry error of 0.2—0.3 arcsec of the GSC
2.3 (Lasker et al. 2008). The HS'T image was resampled ac-
cording to the new plate solution on to 0.05 x 0.05 arcsec?
pixels using the software SWARP (Bertin et al. 2002) with a
LANCZOS3 interpolation and an oversampling factor of 3.

Figure 1. Optical F550M HST image of the central 3 x 3 arcsec?
region of NGC 1277. The image is shown in arbitrary units in a
logarithmic colour scale chosen to enhance the contrast on the
dust lane. The centre of the relative coordinate system is deter-
mined from a Gaussian fit to the nuclear emission peak.

The final image quality, based on stars in the image field-of-
view, is ~ 0.14-0.15 arcsec (Gaussian FWHM).

3 RESULTS
3.1 Optical morphology

As already discussed by other authors (van den Bosch et al.
2012; Emsellem 2013; Fabian et al. 2013), the HST optical
image shows a prominent dust lane around the centre of
NGC 1277 (Fig. 1). The dust lane has a radius of ~ 0.9 arc-
sec (~ 320 pc), (see also, e.g., Fabian et al. 2013), and is
seen nearly edge-on. van den Bosch et al. (2012) deduce an
inclination of ~ 75°, suggesting a similar inclination for the
galaxy, if the dust lane is in the plane of the galaxy disc. It
has been noted by Fabian et al. (2013) that the large central
mass concentration corresponding to an ~ 10'° Mo BH in
NGC 1277 would imply high circular velocities of 480 km s~!
for gas orbiting in the dust lane.

3.2  2.6-mm continuum emission

The 2.6-mm continuum of NGC 1277 (Fig. 2), obtained from
the high-spatial-resolution data, shows an integrated flux of

of 3.36 arcsec. The continuum is found to be extended at the
spatial resolution of 1 arcsec and shows a possible weak fea-
ture to the south. In order to probe the continuum extension,
both, a point source and a circular Gaussian model, were fit-
ted to the continuum map after convolution of the models
with the beam. Both models result in AR.A. = —0.15 arc-
sec and ADec = 0.18-0.19 arcsec for the continuum position
with respect to the pointing reference. This is in agreement

with the position derived from the basic blind detection as-
sessment in Sect. 2.1.2. Fitting a point source model, yields
a best-fitting flux of 4.7 mJy. It is obvious that this fit only
recovers about 80 per cent of the total flux of 5.6 mJy, ob-
tained by direct aperture integration. The residual map of
the continuum after subtraction of the point-source model
(Fig. 3, top panel) shows that the continuum has extended
excess emission compared to a point source. Fitting a sin-
gle circular Gaussian instead of a point source, yields best-
fitting parameters of 5.5 mJy for the flux and 0.5 arcsec for
the Gaussian FWHM. The circular Gaussian model recov-
ers most of the flux measured via direct aperture integration,
and the residuals (Fig. 3, bottom panel) are negligible.

3.3 CO(1-0) emission

A very broad CO(1-0) line is clearly detected close to the
pointing reference in the data obtained at low spatial res-
olution (Figs 4 and 5). The line is symmetrically centred
around the systemic velocity of NGC 1277 and marginally
resolved in terms of kinematics. The map of the CO(1-0)
emission, shown in Fig 4, has been computed by spectrally
integrating the data over a symmetric range of 13 channels
of 40-MHz width (i.e. 1380 kms~') around the systemic
velocity of NGC 1277. This wide spectral range has been
selected to cover the full CO(1-0) line profile, as marked
by the vertical dashed lines in the middle panel of Fig. 5,
where the spectrum from the brightest pixel of the emission
peak is displayed. The flux of the CO(1-0) emission peak,
integrated over a pseudo-circular aperture with a diameter
of 6.1 arcsec, and the corresponding H2 mass are listed in
Table 2.

The central CO(1-0) profile (Fig. 5, middle panel) shows
clear indications of a double-horned shape with a stronger
velocity component centred at +530 km s~/ and a less pro-
nounced component centred at —530 km s~!. The compari-

and 4 from Solomon & Vanden Bout (2005) assuming a Milky Way conversion factor of

line maps (see Figs 4—7).

son of the three spectra from an eastern, central, and west-
ern pixel in Fig. 5 suggests that the CO(1-0) kinematics is
marginally resolved in east-west direction. The pronounced
horn at +530 km s~' is mostly contributed by the eastern
part of the CO(1-0) emission peak, while the weaker horn at
—530 km s~' seems to be associated with the western part.

At L-arcsec resolution, in the more extended configura-
tion, a clear ~ 50 detection is only found for the pronounced
velocity component at +530 kms~', as deduced from the
blind detection assessment in Sect. 2.1.2. The narrow-band
image of this single CO(1-0) detection is indicated via the
two solid (black) contours in Fig. 6. This image has been av-
eraged over three 40-MHz channels (i.e. 320 km s~') around
a central velocity of +530 km s~ order to isolate the
line emission as suggested by the detection experiment.
The emission peak is found at AR.A. = 0.48 arcsec and
ADec = 0.15 arcsec, in agreement with the position derived
from the detection experiment. The total flux measured for
this peak in the above image, using a pseudo-circular aper-
ture with a diameter of 1.92 arcsec, and the correspond-
ing H2 mass are listed in Table 2. The spectrum of this
emission peak, extracted from the brightest pixel, is shown
in the top panel of Fig. 7. The spectrum shows a narrow
(roughly three-channel-wide) line centred at +530 km s~1.
In comparison to Fig. 5, it is obvious that this single detec-
tion corresponds to the pronounced red horn of the double-
horned CO(1-0) profile seen in the more compact configura-
tion. Fig. 7 also shows a number of apparent features in the
spectral region at < —1000 km s~!, which we ascribe to the
increasing noise towards higher

in

requencies.

By visually inspecting the l-arcsec resolution data in
light of the double-horned profile seen at 2.9-arcsec resolu-
tion, we found indications of a marginal CO(1-0) emission
peak associated with the blueshifted horn of the profile.
This peak is just above the 3c-level when spectrally inte-
grating the cube over 320 kms‘ around a central velocity
of —420 km s~! (single (blue) contour in Fig. 6). The spec-
trum of this peak is shown in the lower panel of Fig. 7, and
the corresponding total flux and gas mass, derived by inte-
grating the emission over a pseudo-circular aperture with a
diameter of 1.92 arcsec, are listed in Table 2. The peak is
found at AR.A. = —0.63 arcsec and ADec = 0.32 arcsec, i.e.
to the west of the detection associated with the redshifted
horn. Although the current signal-to-noise ratio is low, the
1-arcsec resolution data seem to spatially resolve the east-
west alignment of the redshifted and blueshifted CO(1-0)

emission that has already been indicated by the data at 2.9-
arcsec resolution (Fig. 5).

Possible evidence for CO(1-0) emission from the region
connecting the two emission peaks is found when integrating
the l-arcsec resolution data over the full spectral range cov-
ered by the double-horned profile seen at 2.9-arcsec resolu-
tion (ie. 1380 km s~'). None of the features in the resulting
map, shown as the underlying colour image in Fig. 6, reaches
the 30 limit. However, the map suggests that the two CO(1-
0) emission peaks are located at the opposite ends of an
underlying ridge of positive emission. In view of the double-
horned profile found at lower spatial resolution, it can be
speculated that this emission ridge originates from compo-
nents of the double-horned profile that are just below the
current detection limit.

The clearly detected CO(1-0) emission peak associated
with the velocity of +530 km s~’ shows a spatial offset of
0.6 arcsec to the east compared to the 2.6-mm continuum
emission (Fig. 8). Assuming that the lo positional uncer-
tainty AO for a signal-to-noise ratio SNR and a beam size
Qz is given by AO  Oz/(2 x SNR), the CO(1-0) line emis-
sion involves a positional uncertainty of AO ~ 0.1 arcsec
(using the major axis of the beam size (1.15 arcsec) and the
SNR of the CO(1-0) emission peak of ~ 5.1). Compared
this estimate, the measured offset between the CO(1-0)
tection and the 2.6-mm continuum emission has an ~ 60
significance. (For the continuum peak, the uncertainty is
much smaller than 0.1 arcsec, as it is detected with a much
larger SNR.) For completeness, the marginal detection from
CO(1-0) emission that is kinematically associated with the
opposite side of the double-horned profile has been added
to Fig. 8 (single blue contour). This emission shows an off-
set of about 0.5 arcsec to the west of the continuum peak.
It is also noteworthy that the direction of the offset of the
CO(1-0) emission peaks with respect to the 2.6-mm contin-
uum does not coincide with the possible weak extension of
the continuum to the south, mentioned in Section 3.2.

Marginal evidence of a spatial gradient across the CO(1-
0) kinematic components in east-west direction is also found
in the combined data set after merging the l-arcsec and
2.9-arcsec resolution data. The position-velocity diagram
extracted from this merged data set along a slit oriented
in east-west direction is shown in Fig. 9. Apart from the
dominant +530 km s~' component, the CO(1-0) emission is
characterized by a low signal-to-noise ratio in this spatially-
resolved diagram. However, the diagram indicates that the
highest velocity (+530 km s~') component is located far-

4 DISCUSSION
4.1 CO(1-0) kinematics and BH mass

The CO(1-0) data for NGC 1277 are consistent with a sce-
nario in which the CO(1-0)-emitting molecular gas is dis-
tributed in a ring corresponding to the dust lane (see Fig. 1).
The double-horned line profile shown by the CO(1-0) emis-
sion in the more compact configuration (2.9-arcsec resolu-
tion) in Fig. 5 suggests that CO emission is detected from the
full extent of the dust lane. In Figs 10 and 11, we compare
the CO(1-0) line profile to model predictions for different
gas distributions and BH masses, based on a realistic model
of the mass distribution in the centre of NGC 1277. Accord-
ing to the data by van den Bosch et al. (2012), the half-light
radius is 1 kpc, and the total stellar mass is 1.2 x 10'' Mo.
The distribution of light is such that a maximum of circu-
lar velocity of 476 km s~! is reached at a radius of 0.56 kpc,
when the mass-to-light ratio is selected as M/Ly = 6.3. This
mass distribution corresponds also to the model of Emsellem
(2013), although the peak velocity is now 600 km s~', with a
higher M/Ly = 10. We therefore adopted for the rotational
velocity due to the stars the curve labelled ‘no BH’ in fig. 4 of
Emsellem (2013), corresponding to the best multi-Gaussian
expansion fit of the light distribution. To this stellar con-
tribution, we added a point mass with two different values,
as shown in Figs 10 and 11. For the molecular gas, we first
assume a nuclear ring, corresponding to the dust lane. The
ring is modelled using a constant surface density between
0.8 and 1.2 arcsec radii, or between 0.28 and 0.42 kpc. Since
this distribution does not allow us to sample the high veloc-

Figure 5. Spectra extracted from an eastern, central, and
western pixel in the CO(1-0) emission peak, as indicated in
Fig. 4. The spectra are shown at a spectral resolution of 40
MHz (105.8 km s~'). The vertical dotted lines mark +530 and
—530 km s~!, which roughly coincides with the peaks of the
double-horned line profile. The vertical dashed lines indicate the
symmetric spectral range of 13 channels around the systemic ve-
locity that was used to compute the integrated CO(1-0) map pre-
sented in Fig. 4.

ities expected in the centre near the BH, we also consider
another extreme molecular gas distribution, which is an ex-
ponential disc with a scale of ro = 50 pc, ending also at
0.42 kpc. For these two molecular gas distributions, we test
two values for the BH mass, the high value of 1.7 x 10'° Mo
proposed by van den Bosch et al. (2012) and the lower value
of 5 x 10° Me selected by Emsellem (2013), which is con-
sistent with the most recent measurement by Walsh et al.
(2016). The inclination of the gas disc is assumed i = 75°.
The combination of these scenarios yields four possible
spectra, which we computed according to the model already
used by Wiklind et al. (1997). For an assumed axisymmet-
ric gas distribution of surface density n(r), a typical global
spectrum dN/dv(V) is the sum over all radii r of

where V;ot (7) is the rotational velocity at radius r, and i the

tended configuration. The two (black) 30 and 4o contours (232
and 310 mJy beam! km s~!) east of the reference position
show the only clear CO(1-0) detection, obtained by spectrally
integrating the data cube over three channels of 40 MHz (i.e.
320 km s~') around a central velocity of +530 km s~! (see also
Sect. 2.1.2). This detection corresponds to the redshifted horn of
the double-horned profile detected in the more compact configura-
tion (Fig. 5). The (blue) 30 contour (263 mJy beam~! km s~!)
west of the reference position shows a marginal detection from
the blueshifted horn of the profile, obtained by spectrally inte-
grating three channels of 40 MHz (i.e. 320 km s~!) around a
central velocity of —420 km s~!. The underlying colour image
shows the map obtained by integrating the cube over the full
spectral range of the double-horned profile (ie. 13 channels of
40 MHz or 1380 km s~!, as indicated by the dashed vertical lines
in Fig. 5). White dashed contours mark the 0 to —3a levels at
0.0, —207, —413, and —620 mJy beam~! km s~}, respectively.

observed velocity in each point is V = Vict cos 6 sin 7, and the
global spectrum is derived by a simple radial integration.
Fig. 10 shows the four spectra obtained when varying the
BH mass and the adopted molecular gas distribution.

The simulation clearly shows that the most likely gas
distribution is indeed the nuclear ring, corresponding to the
dust lane. For the case of an exponential gas distribution,
the velocity wings of the line are boosted, which is not ob-
served. The ring-like gas distribution is also supported by the
preliminary results for the underlying spatial and kinematic
structure of the CO(1-0) emission, discussed in Sect. 3.3 and
summarized in the form of the position-velocity diagram in
Fig. 9. The emission components corresponding to the high-
est velocities around +530 and —530 km s~! are most en-
hanced and show the strongest evidence for a spatial sepa-
ration. Such a position-velocity diagram is expected for gas
orbiting in an inclined ring, where the highest line-of-sight
velocities coincide with the orbital nodes of the ring, i.e. the
edges of the projected lane of gas. For a smooth gas distri-
bution, these edges would, furthermore, be characterized by
enhanced gas emission as a result of line-of-sight projection

effects. On the contrary, for gas orbiting around a central
point mass in an inclined exponential disc, the highest ve-
locities and strongest emission would be found in the centre.

If the molecular gas is distributed in the dust lane, the
rotational velocities probe the total enclosed mass. The two
horns of the observed CO(1-0) profile in Fig. 5 are roughly
located at V = +530 and —530 kms~! with respect to
the systemic velocity of NGC 1277. For an inclination of
i = 75°, this corresponds to a rotational velocity of Vrot =
V/cos(90° — i) © 550 kms~'. The enclosed mass is given
by Mene = (Vier)/G, where r is the distance of the gas
from the BH and G is the gravitational constant. Using a
istance of r ~ 320 pc (0.9 arcsec), corresponding to the
radius of the dust lane, the resulting total enclosed mass is
Mene ~ 2X 10'° Mg. The models in Figs 10 and 11 provide a
more detailed analysis by distinguishing the stellar and BH
mass contributions. Compared to the line profile in Fig. 5,
the best model for M/Ly = 6.3 (Fig. 10) appears to be
the top left one, supporting the high mass for the BH. For
M/Ly = 10 (Fig. 11), the width of the observed CO(1-0)
spectrum can also be reproduced by the 5 x 10° Mo BH (top
right panel). We conclude that the observed CO(1-0) line
profile is consistent with a 1.7 x 10'° Mo BH, while a lower
mass of 5 x 10° Mo is likewise possible, if the underlying
mass distribution is characterized by M/Ly = 10.

In the data at 1-arcsec spatial resolution, the only clear
CO(1-0) detection is associated with the pronounced kine-

lute, but blueshifted, velocities. This emission may originate
from a region close to the western orbital node of the dust
lane. The Hz masses derived for the eastern and western
emission peaks are ~ 2 x 10° and ~ 1 x 10" Mo, respec-
tively (see Table 2). These values are at the upper end o!
the gas masses found for the most massive giant molecular
clouds in the Milky Way (e.g. Murray 2011). In addition
to the molecular cloud scenario, it is also possible that the
peaks are enhanced by line-of-sight crowding effects, which
would be expected around the orbital nodes of an incline
ring model. The above interpretation, in which the CO(1-0)
peaks are associated with the orbital nodes of the dust lane,

continuum peak with the optical galaxy nucleus.

4.2 The molecular gas as a reservoir for star
formation

The CO(1-0) emission discussed here indicates a reser-
voir of molecular gas in the central region of NGC 1277,
which can potentially fuel star formation. The H2 mass of
1.5 x 10° Mg (Table 2) corresponding to the double-horned
profile seen at 2.9-arcsec resolution is in good agreement
with the typical Hz masses found for early-type galaxies
from ATLAS*? (Young et al. 2011), but lower than the in-
tegrated Hz masses found for dust-lane early-type galaxies
(4 x 108 to 2 x 10!° Mo, Davis et al. 2015). A rough es-

MNRAS 000, 1-15 (0000)
/n/ntimate of the mean surface density of the 1.5 x 10° Mo of
molecular gas in NGC 1277 results in about 500 Ms pe?.
According to the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation (Schmidt 1959;
Kennicutt 1998), this could imply a star formation rate den-
sity of ~ 0.5 Mo yr ' kpc? and an integrated star forma-
tion rate of the order of 0.1 Mo yr_'. For this estimate, the
size of the molecular gas reservoir and star formation re-
gion is assumed to be the ring confined to radii between 0.8
arcsec and 1.2 arcsec, consistent with the model presented
in Sect. 4.1. However, the exact dimensions of the ring are
unknown, so that this estimate involves large uncertainties.
In addition, it also has to be taken into account that the
mean gas surface density may not be a good representa-
tion of the actual surface density, since the gas distribution
could be clumpy. Further insights into the clumpiness of the
gas distribution could be obtained from high resolution ob-
servations. However, based on the current sensitivity limit
of the data obtained at l-arcsec resolution, it remains un-
clear whether the observed CO(1-0) emission peaks rather
originate from giant molecular clouds or from line-of-sight
projection effects.

UV data from the GALEX (Martin et al. 2005) archive
independently suggest a low level of active star formation
in NGC 1277 with a global star formation rate of the or-
der of 0.1 Mo yr~!. The far-UV (FUV) flux reported for
NGC 1277 in the GALEX archive is (20.24 + 0.52) pJy, or
(67.2 + 1.7) pJy after correction for foreground extinction
using E(B — V) = 0.165 from Schlegel et al. (1998) and
Apuv = 7.9E(B-—V) (Gil de Paz et al. 2007). This flux ap-
pears to be associated with a slightly extended detection in
the far- and near-UV images. The corresponding luminos-
ity is Lpuv = 8.9 x 10*' erg s~‘. Together with the total
infrared luminosity of NGC 1277 of Lig(8 — 1000 jum)
2.3 x 10° Lo = 8.8 x 10” erg s~!, which we will derive in
Sect. 4.3, the FUV detection indicates a dust-corrected star
formation rate of about 0.2 Mo yr~!, using the calibration

SFR = 4.6 x 10°-““[Lruy + 0.46Lir (8 — 1000 ym)! (2)

(Hao et al. 2011; Calzetti 2013). Note that this calibration
is based on a Kroupa initial mass function, while a Salpeter
initial mass function would result in a 55 per cent larger
star formation rate (e.g. Smith et al. 2015). The actual star
formation rate may be lower than the value derived above,
since the FUV flux could include contributions from an old
stellar population (cf. Burstein et al. 1988) or an AGN. In
Sections 4.3 and 4.4, we discuss indications for an AGN
in NGC 1277. However, the optical spectra of NGC 1277
presented by Trujillo et al. (2014) and Martin-Navarro et al.
(2015) do not show any prominent AGN emission lines, so
that an AGN, if present, is likely to be weak.

The FUV emission in star forming regions is dominated
by young (< 100 Myr) massive stars. Therefore, the star for-
mation history derived from optical spectra may not be suffi-
ciently sensitive to a low-level of recent star formation with a
rate of a few 0.1 Mo yr~! in a stellar population otherwise
dominated by old stars. The stellar population properties
based on optical spectra for NGC 1277 indicate a uniformly
old = 10 Gyr stellar population (van den Bosch et al. 2012;
Trujillo et al. 2014; Martin-Navarro et al. 2015). Further-
more, the optical spectra presented by Martin-Navarro et al.
(2015) in their Fig. 2 do not provide any strong evidence of
Ha emission as an indicator of active star formation. By

visual inspection, the figure only shows a possible emission
peak close to the Ha wavelength in the nuclear averaged
spectrum, which could be associated with weak emission
from ionized gas.

Since the above estimates for the star formation rate
in NGC 1277 involve large uncertainties, we also have to
consider the possibility that star formation is suppressed
despite the presence of a 1.5 x 10° Mo reservoir of molec-
ular gas. Shear can have a disruptive effect on star forma-
tion by altering the collapse and fragmentation of molecular
clouds (e.g. Hocuk & Spaans 2011; Dobbs & Pringle 2013).
High shear has been discussed as a possible explanation
for the lower star formation efficiency with respect to the
Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, displayed by early-type galax-
ies from the ATLAS®? sample (Davis ct al. 2014). In the
steeply rising gravitational potential towards the centre of
NGC 1277, shear can potentially play a role in preventing
efficient star formation in molecular clouds in the region of
the dust lane.

Active star formation would tend to lower the V-band
stellar mass-to-light ratio compared to a uniformly old stel-
lar population. As discussed in Sect. 4.1, a tendency towards
a lower M/Ly would be in favour of a larger BH mass, be-
cause the required velocity width of the CO(1-0) line profile
can only be reproduced when compensating the smaller stel-
lar mass contribution with a larger central BH mass (see
Figs 10 and 11). However, recent observational data are
rather in support of a high mean stellar mass-to-light ra-
tio in the central region. Based on optical long-slit spectra
obtained in 0.8-arcsec seeing, Martin-Navarro et al. (2015)
suggest that the stellar mass-to-light ratio in NGC 1277
increases towards the nucleus. These data are limited in
spatial resolution and lack detailed information on the run
of the stellar mass-to-light ratio inside the region encom-
passed by the dust lane. The innermost off-nuclear ra-
dial bin in their data roughly corresponds to the radius of
the dust lane. A high stellar V-band mass-to-light ratio of
M/Ly = (9.3 + 1.6) for the central 1.3 arcsec in NGC 1277
has also been reported by Walsh et al. (2016), based on high-
spatial-resolution near-infrared integral field spectroscopy.
This value is derived from stellar-dynamical models assum-
ing a constant mass-to-light ratio, so that possible radial
variations in the mass-to-light ratio are not traced.

4.3 Origin of the 2.6-mm continuum emission

The 2.6-mm continuum flux of NGC 1277 of (5.6+£0.2) mJy
could be associated with star formation or with an AGN-
related radio jet. In order to discuss the origin of this con-
tinuum emission, we show the 2.6-mm continuum flux to-
gether with the infrared-to-radio spectral energy distribu-
tion of NGC 1277 in Fig. 13. The analysis of the spectral
energy distribution is likely to involve uncertainties given
that the composite is based on an inhomogeneous data set.
Furthermore, the significance of the models discussed in the
following is limited by the small number of published data at
radio frequencies. To our knowledge, the only published data
in the radio domain are the 1.4 and 5 GHz detections of 2.85
and 1.6 mJy, respectively, reported by Sijbring (1993), who
found the radio source to be unresolved in the corresponding
13 x 19 arcsec? and 3.5 x 5.2 arcsec” beams.

Fig. 13 shows example models for the available data,

/n/n12. J. Scharwéchter et al.

based on the far-infrared and radio continuum, which under-
predict the flux at 2.6 mm by about one order of magni-
tude. The infrared data include data from Herschel, Spitzer,
and Wise. The Herschel photometry measurement was per-
formed using the Herschel Interactive Processing Environ-
ment (HIPE) 13.0.0. The SPIRE fluxes are from SUSSEX-
TRACTOR, while the results from the TIMELINE FITTER agree
within a few per cent. The PACS fluxes are derived from
aperture photometry with aperture correction included. We
used the python code MBB_EMCEE to fit modified blackbod-
ies to photometry data using an affine invariant Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, with the Herschel
passband response folded (Dowell et al. 2014). Assuming
that all dust grains share a single temperature Ty, that
the dust distribution is optically thin, and neglecting any
power-law component towards shorter wavelengths, the fit
results in a temperature of Ty/(1 +z) = (24.0 + 0.8) K,
a luminosity Lip(8 — 1000 ym) = (2.3 + 0.2) x 10° Lo,
and a dust mass of My = (2.6 + 0.5) x 10° Me for 6 = 2.
For 8 = 1.5, the corresponding values are Ty/(1 +z) =
(27 + 1) K, Lin(8 — 1000 pm) = (2.4 + 0.2) x 10° Lo,
and Mg = (1.3 40.2) x 10° Mo. We also performed a fit
using a free @ parameter, which results in Ty/(1 + z) =
(32 + 5) K, Lir(8 — 1000 wm) = (2.4 + 0.2) x 10° Lo,
Ma = (9+5) x 10° Mo, and 8 = 1.1+0.4. The dust tem-
peratures are similar to the ones found for the cold-to-warm
dust component in galaxies. The cold component (~ 15 -
25 K) has been interpreted as diffuse dust heated by the
general interstellar radiation field from young and/or old
stellar populations, while the warmer component (~ 30 -
40 K) is assumed to be associated with dust in star forming
regions heated by young O and B stars (e.g. Cox et al. 1986).
The uniformly old stellar population of NGC 1277 iden-
tified via optical spectroscopy (van den Bosch et al. 2012;
Trujillo et al. 2014; Martin-Navarro et al. 2015) is likely to
provide heating of diffuse dust by the general interstellar
radiation field. As discussed in Sect. 4.2, NGC 1277 may
also host a low level of active star formation, which could
contribute a warmer dust component. However, it is evi-
dent that the cold-to-warm dust component derived from
the model in Fig. 13 can clearly not account for the contin-
uum emission found at 2.6 mm.

The radio fluxes at 1.4 and 5 GHz have been fitted with
a single power-law of the form S, x v“, resulting in a power-
law index of a = —0.46. This index is in agreement with a
synchrotron spectrum. Given that the stellar population of
NGC 1277 is dominated by old stars (van den Bosch et al.
2012; Trujillo et al. 2014; Martin-Navarro et al. 2015) and
that recent star formation is only present at a low level at
most (Sect. 4.2), it is likely that the 1.4 and 5 GHz data trace
non-thermal emission from an extended radio jet. This con-
clusion is also supported by the fact that the given radio and
far-infrared fluxes indicate a mild radio excess with respect
to the radio-far-infrared relation for star forming galaxies.

Yun et al. (2001), the 70 and 100 ym fluxes for NGC 1277
from Herschel and the 1.4 GHz flux from Sijbring (1993) sug-
gest gq ~ 2.0. A comparison with fig. 6 in Yun et al. (2001)

shows that this q-value indicates some radio excess compared
to the distribution of q-values for far-infrared selected galax-
ies and, therefore, a possible contribution from an AGN. In
other words, using the 1.4~GHz flux as an indicator of the
star formation rate based on the radio-far-infrared correla-
tion (e.g. Yun et al. 2001; Murphy et al. 2011), results in a
recent star formation rate that is about one order of magni-
tude larger than the rates discussed in Sect. 4.2.

The excess of the 2.6-mm continuum in Fig. 13 (both,
when considering the total flux or only the point source con-
tribution) with respect to the synchrotron-like radio contin-
uum derived from the 1.4 and 5 GHz fluxes of NGC 1277
is about one order of magnitude. The 2.6-mm flux indi-
cates an inverted spectral energy distribution from the ra-
dio to the millimetre regime, which cannot be fully ex-
plained by S, x v~°! free-free emission from H11 regions
(cf. Murphy et al. 2011) and rather suggests AGN emis-
sion. Some of this excess at 2.6 mm could be caused by vari-
ability or by extended non-thermal emission probed more
prominently by the larger beam size corresponding to the
1.4 and 5 GHz data. Similarly inverted spectra have been
found for a number of low-luminosity AGN and elliptical
galaxies (Doi et al. 2005, 2011). These authors discuss the
possibility that the strong flux at millimetre wavelengths is
a signature of the accretion disc in an advection-dominated
accretion flow (Ichimaru 1977). More data at radio and mil-
limetre wavelengths will be required for a more stringent
interpretation of the radio-to-millimetre spectral energy dis-
tribution of NGC 1277.

The presence of a weak AGN in NGC 1277 would be
consistent with X-ray data. Fabian et al. (2013) find evi-
dence for an unresolved power-law source with a 0.5-7 keV
luminosity of 1.3 x 10“° erg s~'. A rough estimate indicates
that an AGN producing the X-ray and the non-thermal ra-
dio emission would be in agreement with the known radio-
X-ray correlations for AGN. The 6-cm (5 GHz) flux of
Se cm = 1.6 mJy from Sijbring (1993) corresponds to a lu-
minosity of Lg cm = 5.5 X 10°7 erg st. Using the 0.5-7 keV
as an approximation for the 2-10 keV luminosity, the radio
and X-ray fluxes are consistent with the radio-X-ray corre-
lation, which is, e.g., shown by the corresponding projection
of the Fundamental Plane of BH activity in Merloni et al.
(2003, left-hand panel of their fig. 3).

4.4 Implications for gas accretion on to the BH

If NGC 1277 hosts a BH with a mass of ~ 5 x 10°
to 10!° Mo, this BH is overmassive compared to the
value expected from the Fundamental Plane of BH activity
(Merloni et al. 2003), assuming that the radio continuum as
well as the X-ray power-law source are indeed associated
with an AGN. According to the Fundamental Plane rela-
tion from Giiltekin et al. (2009b), the 6-cm radio luminos-
ity of 5.5 x 10°” ergs ' (see Section 4.3) combined with
an approximate 2-10 keV luminosity of 1.3 x 104° ergs!
(Fabian et al. 2013, and Section 4.3) suggests a BH mass of
about 1 x 108 Mo, which is two orders of magnitude smaller
than the BH mass of 1.3x10'° to 1.7x10'° Mo suggested by
van den Bosch et al. (2012) and Yildirm et al. (2015) and
still significantly smaller than the revised BH mass mea-
surement of (4.9 + 1.6) x 10° Mo from Walsh et al. (2016).

There is evidence that the gas accretion on to the

point source in NGC 1277 is much smaller than the one
expected for radiatively efficient Bondi accretion, remains
unclear. Fabian et al. (2013) suggest the possibility of a very
radiatively-inefficient accretion process. Alternatively, gas
angular momentum may be responsible for lowering the ac-
cretion rate (Li et al. 2013).

The dust lane is likely to play an important role in im-
peding cold gas accretion. This has already been pointed out
by Fabian et al. (2013), considering the high velocities in the
dust lane that would be expected from the large BH mass.
Our data support this picture, since the CO(1-0) detection
is consistent with emission from a ring and shows the pre-
dicted high rotational velocities. While the gas in the dust
lane may eventually loose angular momentum due to viscous
processes and begin to spiral inward, the current lack of cold
gas in the nuclear region may be the reason for the very low
current BH accretion rate.

5 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We have reported a detection of CO(1-0) emission from
NGC 1277, probed at ~ 1 and ~ 2.9 arcsec spatial reso-
lution, using the IRAM PdBI. The data indicate that the
molecular gas is distributed in the ring of the dust lane en-
compassing the nucleus of NGC 1277 at a distance of 0.9 arc-

sec. Furthermore, the molecu
velocities of ~ 550 km s~!. Th

lar gas shows high rotational
is is suggested consistently by

the low- and high-resolution data. The low-resolution data
reveal a very broad, double-horned line covering a symmet-
ric velocity range around the systemic velocity of NGC 1277,
which appears marginally resolved in terms of kinematics
in east-west direction. In the high-resolution data, the pro-
nounced red horn of the double-horned profile, centred at
~ +530 km s~!, is detected with an offset of ~ 0.6 arc-
sec to the east of the 2.6-mm continuum peak, while a
marginal detection of kinematic components associated with
the blue horn are found to the west of the continuum peak.
The high rotational velocities of the molecular gas provide
independent evidence for a central mass concentration of
~ 2x 10'° Mo inside the radius of the dust lane. This en-
closed mass is large enough to potentially host an ultra-

massive BH as massive as reported by van den Bosch et al.
(2012) and Yildirim et al. (2015) based on stellar kinemat-
ics. Compared to models with realistic mass distributions
for M/Ly = 6.3, the spatially-unresolved CO(1-0) line pro-
file is consistent with the profile expected for the presence
of a central 1.7 x 10'° Mo BH. However, a lower-mass BH
of 5 x 10° Mo, consistent with the revised measurement by
Walsh et al. (2016), is also possible, if the stellar mass-to-
light ratio is assumed to be M/Ly = 10.
/n/n14. J. Scharwéchter et al.

Future observations are required in order to further
resolve this ambiguity in the gas-kinematic measurement.
Tighter gas-kinematic constraints on the BH mass can be
expected from sensitive observations at high angular resolu-
tion, by probing gas clouds as close as possible to the BH
(ie. the gas with the highest rotational velocities). If the
molecular gas is indeed largely confined to a ring, such ob-
servations will ultimately be limited by the lack of gas in
the vicinity of the BH. However, depending on the radial
extent of the ring, gas kinematics from the innermost parts
of the ring may already be sufficiently sensitive to the cen-
tral gravitational potential to provide a clearer distinction
between the BH mass and extended stellar mass contribu-
tions. A better knowledge of the stellar mass-to-light ra-
tio in the circum-nuclear region could similarly improve the
gas-kinematic BH mass constraints. Stellar absorption line
studies for NGC 1277 have so far been limited in spatial res-
olution (see, e.g., the discussion by Yildirim et al. 2015), so
that the detailed run of stellar mass-to-light ratio with radius
inside the region encompassed by the dust lane remains un-
certain. Recent results by Walsh et al. (2016) indicate a high
stellar mass-to-light ratio of M/Ly = 9.3+1.6 for the central
region of NGC 1277. This measurement is based on stellar-
dynamical models assuming a constant mass-to-light ratio
out to a radius of 1.3 arcsec (~ 460 pc), which covers the
full extent of the dust lane. This value would be in favour of
an ~ 5x 10° Mo gas-kinematic BH mass, in agreement with
the stellar-dynamical mass derived by Walsh et al. (2016).

The strong underlying 2.6-mm continuum emission of
NGC 1277 cannot be explained by the cold dust component
seen in the far-infrared and appears to be in excess of the
radio-to-millimetre spectral energy distribution expected for
free-free emission from H1I regions. Based on literature X-
ray and radio data, we suggest that the 2.6-mm continuum
is caused by a weak AGN. The continuum is extended and
shows marginal evidence of an extension to the south that
could be related to a radio-jet.

If the BH in NGC 1277 is as massive as ~ 5 x 10° to
~ 1.7 x 10!° Mo, it appears to be an overmassive outlier
with respect to the Fundamental Plane of BH activity as
well as the Mguy-Lspn,x«-relation — although the latter may
strongly depend on the details of the bulge-disc decompo-
sition (Savorgnan & Graham 2016). It is likely that the pe-
culiar properties of NGC 1277 are a result of its location
in the environment of the Perseus Cluster. It has been sug-
gested that the formation of ultramassive BHs may have
proceeded rapidly in the early Universe, well before z ~ 2-3
(Dubois et al. 2012; Fabian et al. 2013). Early BH growth in
NGC 1277 is supported by the fact that NGC 1277 seems to
currently lack any significant BH accretion. The offset from
the Mpu-Lspn,«-relation indicates that NGC 1277 has either
lost a large part of its stellar mass or has not been able to ac-
quire additional stellar mass and gas after an initial phase of
star formation. Furthermore, the predominantly old stellar
population, the currently small BH accretion rate, and the
offset from the Fundamental Plane of BH activity suggest
that NGC 1277 has been devoid of gas during its recent evo-
lution. A stripping event in the cluster environment could
have removed large parts of the gas and stellar mass, al-
though this scenario has so far been regarded less likely (e.g.
van den Bosch et al. 2012). If NGC 1277 has been moved
off the Mpu-Lspn,x-relation by tidal stripping, this implies

that galaxies with ultramassive BHs have been close to, or
in agreement with, this relation by z ~ 2-3 and that ultra-
massive BHs have primarily evolved in lockstep with their
host galaxies. Alternatively, as suggested by Fabian et al.
(2013), NGC 1277 may have undergone quenching at high
redshift and may have been prevented from acquiring fur-
ther gas and stellar mass by its off-centre location in the
Perseus Cluster, in contrast to central cluster galaxies which
may have grown significantly through mergers. In this case,
NGC 1277 would have neither experienced galaxy nor BH
growth in its more recent evolution and may be a ‘relic’
galaxy (Trujillo et al. 2014), in terms of both, its stellar pop-
ulation and BH. This scenario has recently been explored in
more detail by Ferré-Mateu et al. (2015). As these authors
iscuss, this scenario implies that the growth of ultramassive
BHs may have preceded the growth of their host galaxies, so
that all galaxies with ultramassive BHs may have been out-
liers from the BH-bulge luminosity (mass) relation by z ~
2-3, in a similar manner as still observed for NGC 1277 to-
ay. It is noteworthy that the BH in the central galaxy of
the Perseus Cluster, NGC 1275, is significantly less massive
than the one suggested for NGC 1277 (Scharwachter et al.
2013). As a possible explanation, Shields & Bonning (2013)
proposed that NGC 1277 may have captured a massive BH
that had originally grown in NGC 1275.

Regardless of which process may have led to this par-
ticular BH distribution in NGC 1275 and NGC 1277, it is
evident that probing the most massive BHs in clusters will
provide new insights into cluster formation and evolution.
Given the very small number of confirmed ultramassive BHs
to-date, future observations are required in order to better
understand the growth of the most massive BHs and their
host galaxies as well as the role of the cluster environment.

/n/nNOTE ADDED IN PROOF

Based on a new bulge/disc decomposition and new stellar-
kinematic data, Graham et al. (2016) propose that NGC
1277 might be brought back on the BH-to-host spheroid
mass relation, albeit with a high M/Ly = 12.3.
