Random partitions of the plane via Poissonian
coloring, and a self-similar process of
coalescing planar partitions

David J. Aldous *
January 3, 2017

Abstract

Plant differently colored points in the plane; then let random points
“Poisson rain”) fall, and give each new point the color of the nearest
existing point. Previous investigation and simulations strongly sug-
gest that the colored regions converge (in some sense) to a random
partition of the plane. We prove a weak version of this, showing that
normalized empirical measures converge to Lebesgue measures on a
random partition into measurable sets. Topological properties remain
an open problem. In the course of the proof, which heavily exploits
ime-reversals, we encounter a novel self-similar process of coalescing
planar partitions. In this process, sets A(z) in the partition are asso-
ciated with Poisson random points z, and the dynamics are as follows.
Points are deleted randomly at rate 1; when z is deleted, its set A(z)
is adjoined to the set A(z’) of the nearest other point 2’.

/n/nmodel with a Poisson(e“!) number of initial particles and with n ~ e! total
particles.

The advantage of this more sophisticated model is that we can exploit the
exact self-similarity property of the underlying space-time PPP. In particular,
by reversing time the “line of descent” by which a particle acquires its color
from previous particles can be studied. Moreover, suppose the first intuitive
suggestion is true. That is, after assigning different colors to particles at
positions z at time t,, suppose there is a t — oo limit random partition
A(t1) of R? into regions A(t, z) occupied by particles with the color of the
particle at z at time t;. This (supposed) partition valued process (A(t1),00 >
t; > —oo), has a simple intuitive description in reversed time. Given A(t)
and the time-t, particle positions z, we obtain A(t, — dt) by the rule

delete each particle with probability dt; for each deleted particle,
at position z say, let z’ be the nearest other particle position, and
replace A(t,, 2’) by A(ti, 2’) U A(ri, 2).

The purpose of this paper is to prove two intertwined results; that the random
partition A(t,) does exist as a certain type of limit of the coloring process
(Theorem |2); and that the resulting reversed-time process (A(t1) : 00 >
t, > —oo) is a self-similar version of the process defined by the rule above
(Theorem [1).

1.1. Notation and more detailed outline

Write R x R? for the set with elements (t,z), interpreted as “time” t € R
and “position” z € R?. Write & for the Poisson point process on R x R? with
mean measure e'dtdz. All the random objects considered in this paper will
be constructed from &. We write a typical “point” of E as € = (te, ze) or
¢ = (te, zc). We consider € as the label for an immortal particle with arrival
or “birth” time tg at position zg, and so

Ba i= {€ ES: te < th}

denotes the set of particles which are alive at time t. Define =z; analogously.
Write

Zar = {% 26 € Ei}
for the positions of the particles at time t. Of course Z<, and Z <q are Pois-
son point processes on R? with rate e’, that is mean measure e'dz, because

4
/n/nfon e*’ ds = e'. The self-similarity properties of the PPP — that Z<, is
distributed as a spatial rescaling of Z<;. — will extend to self-similarity for
the process (A(t;) : 00 > t; > —oo) outlined in the previous section.

To each particle € let us assign a parent particle ¢ = parent(&), defined as
the particle in =;,— for which the Euclidean distance ||z¢ — || is minimized.
This defines a (genealogical) tree process. So for each particle € there is
an ancestral sequence of particles, written (parent{i,é],i > 0), defined by
parent([0, €] = € and then recursively by

parent[? + 1, €] = parent(parent{i, €]), i > 0.

The associated line of descent indicates the ancestor of € at each time t < te,
that is

ancestor(t,€) = parent[?, €] for i > 1 such that tparentfig] < t < tparent[i—1,¢]
(1)
where for completeness we define

ancestor(t, €) = € for t > te.

The first part of the proof (Proposition [4}in section[2) shows that for a typical
particle € present at time 0, the distance to ancestor(—t,&), the ancestor at
time —t, is of order e‘/*, which is the same order as the distance to the nearest
particle present at time —t. In the second part of the proof (section [3) we first
consider two particles present at time 0 and distance r apart. Their lines of
descent merge at some random past time —T}., and we need an upper bound
(Proposition on the tail of the distribution of T.. The methods in these
sections are very concrete — calculations and bounds involving Euclidean
geometry and spatial Poisson processes — though rather intricate in detail.

The limit result we seek involves descendants (rather than ancestors) of
typical particles, and we set up notation as follows] For t; < tg and ¢ € Bey,
define

Descend(ty, to, ¢) := {€ € Zz, : ancestor(t,,€) = ¢}. (2)

This is the set of particles born before t2 whose time-t; ancestor in the line
of descent was ¢. In the coloring story, this is “the set of particles at time

descendant.

different colors”. Then, still for t; < tg and ¢ € E<;,, define

H1;,to,¢ 18 the measure ju putting weight e~”

on the position of each particle in Descend(ty, ta, ¢). (3)

So fe,,t2,¢ is a random element of the space M(R?) of finite measures on R?,
equipped with the usual topology of weak convergence. To obtain the limit
theorem we first show (Proposition 24]in section [4.2) that there exist tg + oo
limits in probability (as M(R?)-valued random variables); that is, there exist
random measures {t1,,00,¢ : ¢ € Z<t,} such that

Ht1,t2,¢ — [ty,00,¢ in probability as tz + 00, (WC € Bey,). (4)

The proof essentially relies on Proposition |4| and self-similarity. We then
use Proposition |13] to show that a limit /14,,.0,¢ is in fact Lebesgue measure
restricted to some random set A(t,,¢), implying that the collection { A(t, ¢) :
¢ € Ec} is necessarily a partition of R?.

For fixed t we can regard

Z) = {(z, A(t, €)) : € € Ea}

as a marked point process. As ¢ increases, the process (Z", —oo < t < 00)
evolves in a way one can describe qualitatively:

new points arrive randomly at rate e’ per unit area per unit time;
when a point € arrives at time t, the region A(t, ¢) associated with
the closest existing point ¢ is split into two regions A(t + dt, ¢)
and A(t + dt, €).

But the probability distribution over possible splits depends on Z in some
complicated way which we are unable to describe explicitly.

However, the key feature of this process is that as t decreases the regions
merge according to the simple rule stated earlier. To summarize:

Theorem 1. The space-time PPP {(te, ze) : € € E} can be extended to a
process {(te, ze, A(t,€),t > te): € € E} with the following properties.

(a) For each —co < t < 00 the collection {A(t,§) : € € Zz} is a random
partition of R? into measurable sets.

(b) The distribution of the entire time-varying process {(te, ze, A(t, §),t =
te) : € € S} ts invariant under the action of the Euclidean group on R?.

(c) The process whose state at time t is {(ze, A(t, €)) : € € Zz} evolves in
reversed time according to the rule:
/n/nduring [t,t — dt], for each € € Be, delete € (that is, remove the
entry (ze, A(t, €)) ) with probability dt; for each deleted particle €,
let ¢ be the nearest other particle, and set A(t —dt,¢) = A(t,¢)U

A(t, §).

(d) The action of the scaling map z > e~*/?z on R? that takes the distribution
of Z<q to the distribution of Z< also takes the distribution of {(ze, A(0, €)) :
€ € Exo} to the distribution of {(ze, A(t,€)) : € € Za}.

The earlier statement can now be rephrased as follows, where we
define fi,t),¢ as at @ and consider it as an M(R”)-valued random variable.
Write A, for Lebesgue measure restricted to A C R?.

Theorem 2. For each € € Ec; we have
Ht,t2,¢ > atte) in probability as tz —> co

where the limit random sets {A(t,€) : € € Z<,} comprise a process with the
properties stated in Theorem|

Note this implies that the limit random sets here and in Theorem |1] are
o(&)-measurable.

Theorem [2] is a formalization of the “limit colored regions exist” result
described in the opening section, but this particular formalization is math-
ematically weak in two senses. Our formalization via weak convergence of
empirical measures means, in the original “elementary” version, that we are
ignoring positions of o(n) size subsets of the n particles. Second, our proof
gives no information about topological properties of the regions A(t, €), only
that they are measurable. In fact because the regions A(t,€) are identified
via the Lebesgue measure they support, they are only well-defined up to
Lebesgue-null sets of R?. So, for instance, the natural question “is € an
element of A(t,€)?” is not well-posed. But it is natural to guess that the
following is true.

Conjecture 3. For each t one can identify the regions {A(t,€): € € Baz}
so that the topological boundary of each region has Lebesgue measure zero.

If true, we could rephrase the question above as the well-posed question
“ig each € in the interior of A(t,€)?”, and we conjecture the answer is Yes.
More interestingly, assuming Conjecture 3] is true, it is natural to conjecture
/n/nthat the boundaries have some (suitably defined) non-random fractal dimen-
sion 1 < d < 2, and section|5.3]contains heuristic discussion. Further related
remarks are in the next section. Finally, one might expect the regions to be
connected sets, but this seems incorrect — see section [5.3.2]

1.2. Background and analogous models
To quote the unpublished notes [11]

The [elementary] model is described in [[13], sec. 7.6.8, pp. 270-
271}, although we are not sure of its origins: [we] probably first
learned of the problem from Mathew Penrose in about 2003,
while Ben Hambly [personal communication] recalls that the same
problem arose elsewhere at about the same time.

The context of that line of work was on-line algorithms in computational
and stochastic geometry. Separately the present author learned {personal
communication] that the elementary model has been considered by Ohad
Feldheim as a spatial analog of the Polya urn process.

The approach in [IJ] to the elementary model is to identify colored regions
in the unit square as Voronoi regions, that is the set of points for which the
nearest particle has a given color. Then via the Hausdorff metric on closed
sets, it makes sense to ask whether our notion of convergence of empirical
measures can be strengthened to include convergence of Voronoi regions. In
our language and model, this could only be true if Conjecture [3] is true.
Arguments in [LI] focus on the length ¢, of the boundary between the two
regions (for two colors and n particles in the unit square). Using arguments
with a more geometric flavor than ours, they raise and discuss the question of
whether ¢,, = O(n“/?) for some d < 2. This mirrors our “fractal dimension”
question, and indeed would imply that Conjecture |3]is true. The arguments
in this paper make surprisingly little use of the “local geometry” of the PPP,
so one can hope that our results might be combined with more geometric
arguments to make further progress.

Note also that, intuitively, the area of the Voronoi region of a given color
should behave almost as a martingale, because a new particle near the bound-
ary seems equally likely to make the area larger or smaller. If one could bound
the martingale approximation well enough to establish a.s. convergence of
such areas, the results of this paper would follow rather trivially. But doing
so seems to require detailed knowledge of the geometry of the boundary.

/n/nThe author’s own interest in the model arose in the context of a scale-
invariant random spatial network (SIRSN) [2] 3], studied as abstractions of
road networks. A general conjecture is that any network built dynamically
from randomly-arriving Poisson points by means of edges (now line segments
in the plane) being created to attach an arriving point to the existing network
by a “scale-invariant rule” (that is, a rule which uses only relative distances,
not absolute distances) should in the limit define a SIRSN. Of course the
rule in our model “create an edge from the newly-arrived point to the closest
existing point” is about the simplest scale-invariant rule one can imagine]
The fact that this “simplest case” is hard to analyze suggests that the general
conjecture is very challenging.

There is extensive literature on stochastic fragmentation and coalescence
models in the non-geometric “mean-field” setting [4] [6]. There is also sub-
stantial literature (see e.g. [7] Chapter 9) concerning random partitions of the
plane (tessellations, tilings etc). But the combination of these themes, that
is Markovian processes of refining or coarsening partitions in the plane, has
been considered only in special refining models [8] and in variants of the STIT
model [9} [14]. The coalescing partitions process in Theorem [I] is perhaps the
only known self-similar Markovian process of pairwise merging partitions of
R? with explicit rates. See section for further brief comments.

2 <A bound on ancestor displacement

2.1 Compactness for the marked point process

Our first objective is to obtain a concrete bound, Proposition |4) on the
distance between the position z¢ of a particle € (present at time 0) and the
position Zancestor(—t,¢) Of its ancestor at time —t.

Some notation:

e 0 is the origin in R?.
e ||x — y|| denotes Euclidean distance in R?.

e disc(z,r) is the closed disc with center z and radius r.

4Unfortunately the tree-like structure of this model implies it does not satisfy the
requirement of a SIRSN that mean route lengths be finite.
/n/ne For measurable B C R? write area(B) for its area (2-dimensional
Lebesgue measure) and diam(B) = sup, ,cg ||« — y|| for its diameter.

Proposition 4. There exists a function G(r) | 0 as rt 00 such that, for all
z € R’ and allt > 0, conditional on E<q having a particle € with ze = z and
te > —t we have

G,(r) = P(||Zancestor(—t,¢) _ Fall > ret/?) < G(r), O<r<o.
Moreover J>° rG(r)dr < co.

The rest of section |2]is devoted to the proof of Proposition |4] and a variant
(Proposition [9). As mentioned earlier, the conceptual point of Proposition [4|
is that the distance to the time t (in the past) ancestor is the same order of
magnitude as the distance to the closest particle at that time, that is order
e/?. An expression for G(r) is given at (17).

The elementary “thinning” property of Poisson processes leads to a cor-

responding property of our space-time Poisson point process &. As ¢ runs
backwards over oo > t > —oo, the processes E<; evolve according to the rule

each particle is deleted at stochastic rate 1.

This Poisson thinning process representation is the foundation for much of
our analysis, as are the related self-similarity properties of our derived pro-
cesses, discussed in section [4-1]

To be pedantic, in forwards time we work with the filtration F, = o(E<,).
In reversed time we work with the filtration

F,= o((max(te,t), ) » €€ 3). (5)

_
So F; tells us the positions of all particles, and the arrival times of particles
born after time t, and the following “thinning process” property holds.

+
Lemma 5. Conditional on F;, the previous lifetimes {t — te: ze € Z<:} of
the particles alive at time t are i.i.d. with Exponential(1) distribution.

2.2 Derivation of an EA process

We study lines of descent in the genealogical tree process. Consider a particle
€ present at time 0 at position zo. From the thinning process representation,

10
/n/nits arrival time Tp < 0 is such that —Tp has Exponential(1) distribution. For
i > 1 write (Jj, Z;) for the arrival time and position of its i’th generation
ancestor, that is parent{i,€]. We will show how to represent this process in
terms of a certain Markov process we will call the excluded area (EA) process.

Conditional on {To = to} the particles present at ty are distributed as the
PPP =.;,, and so parent|i, €] is the closest such point to zo, at position Z,
say. Conditional also on {Z,; = z,}, we know there are no points of Ze, in
the interior of C) := disc(zo, ||z1 — 20||). The arrival time T; of Z, has density
function x e' on —oo < t < to, implying that to — T; has Exponential(1)
distribution.

Now given To = to and (7), 21) = (t1, 1), the information we have about
Ect, is precisely the fact that it has no points in Cj. So Z» is the closest
point to 2, in a PPP of rate e on R?\ ©. And as before, t; — T> has
Exponential(1) distribution.

Now given Ty = to and (7), Z1) = (t1, 21) and (Th, Za) = (te, z2), we have
built an “excluded region” C2 := C Udise(z1, ||z2— zi||). The information we
have about E<;, is precisely that it is a PPP of rate e with no points in C2,
and we can continue inductively to describe the entire process ((Tj, Z;),4 > 0).

2.3 Definition of the EA process

Here we re-specify the process above in intrinsic terms. Working with time
{| —oo is rather counter-intuitive, so in the definition below it seems helpful
to reverse the direction of time.

Consider the space C of triples c = (C, z,r) such that

C is a compact set in R?; 2z€C; 0<T<o.

Given an clement c = (C,z,7) € C we can define a probability distribution
He on C as follows. Take a PPP = of rate e~7 on R?\ C. Let € be the point
of & closest to z. Set

z= €; C’ = CUdise(z, ||€ — 2||); 7’ =7 +8
where 9 has Exponential(1) distribution independent of =. Then let [Me be
the distribution of (C’, z’,7’).
Define the EA process to be the C-valued Markov chain (C; = (C;, Z;, 7:),0 <
i < co) where, for each step i, the conditional distribution of C;;, given

C; = c is the distribution 1. specified above. Figure [3] provides an illus-
tration. It is straightforward to formalize the argument in section to
show

Lemma 6. Condition on & containing a particle € with te < 0 and z = 2.
The process ((tparent{i,€]> Zparent{i,e]),0 < i < 00) of arrival times and positions
of the ancestors of this € is distributed as the random process ((—7;, Zi),0 <
i < oc) within the EA process ((Cj, Z;,T;),0 < i < co) with initial state
({zo}, 20,70), where T| has Exponential(1) distribution.

Terminology. In what follows we write step for the steps 7 of the EA
chain, and time for the r’s.

2.4 Geometric analysis of the EA process
It is enough to study the standard EA process with initial state
(Co, 20,7) = ({O}, 0, 70)

where 7 has Exponential(1) distribution} So in the context of Lemma ig
we will study ancestors of a particle present at position 0 at time 0. The

that particles are labeled by position and arrival time.

12
/n/nstarting observation, Lemma [7] below, is an expression for the growth of the
area of C;, at each step. After that we use geometric arguments to bound the
diameter of C; in terms of its area. Because Z; is on the boundary of C; this
will be enough to prove Proposition

Lemma 7. Conditional on C; = (C;,2%,7:), the increment area(Cj41) —
area(C;) has Exponential(e~") distribution, independent of Ti41 — Ti.

Proof. Writing a, for the area of disc(z;,7) \ Ci,
P(area(Cj41) — area(C;) > a,)

= P( no point of a rate e~% Poisson process in disc(z;,1r) \ C;)

= exp(—e “a,).

The independence holds by construction.

We can lower bound the diameter in terms of the area via the classica.
fact (called Bieberbach’s inequality or the isodiametric inequality — see [12]
for a short proof) that the disc is extremal:

area(C’) < 4(diam(C))*, all compact C C R’. (6

We want a corresponding upper bound, to verify that Cj does not become
long and thin. The bound will rely upon the following geometry lemma.

Lemma 8. Let C be a compact set in R? and let D be a closed disc whose
center is in C. Then

diam(C'U D) < max (<iam(c) + /Bearealcup arent) (eee) .

Proof. The right side clearly bounds the distance between two points in C,
and also between two points in D because

sup ||z — 2’|| = diam(D) = vi area(D) < vi area(C'U D).

So it will suffice to prove the bound for one point in C’ and the other in D,
that is to prove

2(area(C U D) — area(C))

sup ||z— 2"|| — diam(C) < / (7)

z€C,2/ED

13
/n/nFigure 4: Illustration of proof of Lemma [|

Figure [4] illustrates the argument.

First assume C’ is convex. If D C C the result is trivial, so suppose not.
Let y be a point on the boundary of D at maximal distance (= ro, say) from
C, and let w be a point in C' with ||y — w|| = ro. Then

sup{||z — 2’|| : 2 € C,2’ € D} < diam(C) +19 (8)

by applying the triangle inequality to the point in C' closest to 2’. Now
consider the half-spaces defined by the line @ through w that is orthogonal
to the line segment wy. The convex set C must lie in the half-space not
containing y, else by convexity some point in C' would be closer to y. And
the tangent line to the disc at y must be parallel to @, otherwise some other
point on the boundary would be farther from C' than is y. But this implies
that the line segment wy is part of the line segment vy, where v is the center
of the disc D. So r9 < r := radius of D, and

area(C' U D) — area(C) > area(DN H)

where 4 is the half-space containing y. Now area(DNH) is a certain function
of ro and r > ro, and clearly this function is, for fixed r9, minimized at r = ro,
and there its value is arg. So

area(C'U D) — area(C’) > $79

14
/n/nand combining with gives (7).
In proving we assumed C' was convex. For general C' we can apply
to its convex hull C* and then, noting

diam(C*) = diam(C), area(C* U D) — area(C”) < area(C U D) — area(C)

we see that remains true for non-convex C.

2.5 Completing the proof of Proposition

Returning to the standard EA process C; = (C;, Z;, 71), we now have sufficient
tools to study 7; and

Aj; :=area(C;), D; := diam(C;).

From Lemma |7| we obtain a constructive representation of the distribution
of ((Aj, 7;),0 < i < 00), as follows.

The process (7;, i > 0) forms a Poisson process of rate 1 on (0,00). (9)
Aj = Yo e710; where (6;,j > 0) are i.i.d. Exponential(1),
independent of (7;, i > 0). (10)

Then from Lemma [§| we get the inequality

cess (04, > 1). So Proposition [A] holds for
G(r) := P(x >1r), 0<r<oco (17)

and it is easy to check that to rG(r)dr < oo.

2.6 A large deviation bound for occupation times

The following technical bound will enable us to bound the distance required
for two lines of descent to merge (Proposition [13] later).

Proposition 9. For the standard EA process write
B= Ufgiser/? diam(C,)>8} [7-1 Ti)

16
/n/nThen for sufficiently large b there exist A < oo and p> 0 such that
P(Leb(BN [0,T]) > T/3) < Aexp(-pT), 0<T<c (18)
where Leb denotes Lebesgue measure.

We previously used inequality (12) to bound D; := diam(C;) in terms of
the areas A; = area(A;). Here we oi use a slightly different bound.

Lemma 10. D; < fat + v0 2Ar Ay)

Ai inequality becomes

But the term ( (/ —4/ dant) is negative, and Do = = 0, so we find

establishing the asserted bound.

Proof. Setting Dd; = Di -

Recall the notation from (9[10): (7;, j > 0) denotes a Poisson process
of rate 1 on (0,00), and (4;,7 > 0) denotes i.i.d. Exponential(1) random
variables independent of (7;, 1 > 0). From and Lemma 10}

To prove Proposition[9] we will rephrase inequalities from section [2.5]in terms
of continuous-time processes. Set Vj = 0 and define (V;,0 < t < co) to be
the process which increments by 0; at time 7;, and otherwise decreases at
exponential rate 1. In symbols, writing N} = less};

where

dV, = —Vidt + > 6;dNj.

17
/n/nAt time 7;— (just before the jump at 7;) we have
i-l
Vi. = S007 = TA.
j=0

Because V; is decreasing on [1;-1,7;) we have
if ec" A; > ba then V, > by on [7;-1, 7). (20)

Similarly, define (W;,0 < t < 00) to be the process which increments by 6; 2
at time 7;, and otherwise decreases at exponential rate 1/2. Take Wo =
In symbols,
dW, = —3Wrdt + > 0;?aNj.
j
At time 7;— we have

i-l
W,,- = So oP? = RDF,
j=0

So as at
if e 7? Ds > bp then W; > bp on (7-1, 7:). (21)

Combining with for appropriate b4, bp defined in terms of b, we
now see that the proof of Proposition 9 reduces to proofs of large deviation
bounds for occupation measures of the processes (V;) and (W;). That is, it
suffices to prove

Proposition 11. For sufficiently large b there exist A < co and p > 0 such
that

T
P (/ Lpvsoy dt > 1/6) < Aexp(-pT), 0<T<o (22)
0
T
P (/ Loves) dt > 1/0) < Aexp(—pT), 0<T <oe. (23)
0

We will give the proof for (V;), and then note that essentially the same
proof works for (W;).

18
/n/nFix a high level b. The process regenerates at each downcrossing of b. So

starting from the first downcrossing there is ani.i.d. sequence ((Ly(i), A,(7)), 7 >

1) where Ly is the duration and Ky is the “occupation time above b” between
successive downcrossings. We can decompose Ly as Li, + Ky where Li, is the
time until first upcrossing of b and K; is the subsequent time until the nex
downcrossing of b. It is easy to see

Li, >) 00 as b > 00. (24

It is also easy to see that Ky, >, 0 as b > ov, though we need the stronger
result
im Eexp(6,) =1, 0<0<o0. (25
00

To prove this, note that during an excursion above b the process (V;) is upper
bounded by the process (V,") in which the drift term is —b dt instead of —V; dt.
But the process (V;") describes the workload in a M/M/1 queue with arriva
rate 1 and service rate b. So the distribution of Ky is stochastically smaller
than the server’s busy period in that queue, and from classical exact formulas
for that busy period distribution (e.g. [5]) one can deduce (25).

Writing 7, for the time of the n’th regeneration, and the classical
large deviation theorem for i.i.d. sums imply that for b sufficiently large

P (/ Lpysey dt > n/) =P (x: K,(4) > np) decreases exponentially
0 i=l

as n — oo. Another use of the iid. large deviation theorem applied to the
time intervals Lj, at (24) implies that for b sufficiently large the probabilities
P(t <n) decrease exponentially as n + oo, and this establishes (22).

The argument for is essentially the same, and this completes the
proof of Proposition [9]

3  Coalescence of lines of descent

In this section we continue the style of analysis in section 2] by studying the
lines of descent of two particles present at time 0. This involves a coupled
EA process, whose dynamics are described in section [3-1] Note that Propo-
sition |4] implies that, for particles at distance r >> 1 apart, the “coalesce”
time (time backwards to their most recent common ancestor) must be at

19
/n/nleast (2 — o(1))logr. Our goal is to give an upper bound, Proposition
on the coalesce time distribution. The central idea is to use Proposition [9
to show that, if not coalesced already, the lines of descent at time —t are
typically only order e’/? apart (the same order as the distance to the nearest
time —t particle): this is Proposition [16] A geometric argument then shows
(Lemma 15) that there is a non-vanishing chance to merge in the next gen-
eration backwards. These ingredients are combined in section to prove

Proposition

3.1 The coupled EA process

Fix to > 0. For the rest of section [3] we condition on the time-to configuration
Z<t) containing a particle at position zj and the time-0 configuration Z<o
containing a particle at position z3. The distribution of the line of descent
for each particle is just a translated and scaled version of the distribution of
the EA process in Lemma [6] So we anticipate that the joint distribution of
the two lines of descent can be described in terms of some suitably coupled
versions of the EA process.

Precisely, we will specify the coupled EA process

((C};C?), ¢=0,1,2,...) = ((C}, 2}, 72); (C?, 27,77), ¢=0,1,2,...)

ara

with initial states ({zd}, 24,74) and ({23}, 22,73) where 73 and 74 + to are
independent Exponential(1). At each step (before the coalescence step [coat
below) only one of the components (C} or C?) changes. There are notational
issues in describing this coupled processes. We write (C}; C?) for the configu-
ration after the i’th step of the coupled process. Because only one component
changes in each step before coalescence, we need different notation for the
configuration of a given component after 7 changes of that particular com-
ponent, and we write (Ci) and (Ci) for these “jump processes” of each
component. And it is these jump processes which individually are evolving
as the ordinary EA process.

The evolution rule for the coupled process, which will be derived from
the dynamics of the underlying tree process as was done in Lemma |6} is as
follows.

Write the configuration after i steps as (C};C?). Before step
Teoa we must have 7} # 72; suppose 7} < 7? (the other case is

symmetric). Take a PPP of rate e~” on R? \ (C} U C?), but

20
/n/naugmented with an extra point planted at z?. Let € be the point
of the augmented PPP closest to z}. If € = z? then we say that
the process coalesces at position ed and time TP; write Deoal =
i+ 1 for the coalesce step, Zeoal = 2 for the coalesce position,
Tool = 7? for the coalesce time. Otherwise set C},, = C} U
dise(z}, ||€ — zi||), set z,, = € and take 7/,, = 7} + 6 where
6 has Exponential(1) distribution independent of all previously
constructed random variables. Set C?,, = C?.

Note in particular that the configuration after i steps determines the value
7; = min(7}, 77); (26)

the arg min determines which component will change on the next step and
7; determines the rate e~” of the PPP used to construct the next step.
Remark. For completeness, let us give the behavior of the coupled pro-
cess after coalescence, though this is not directly relevant to our arguments.
If the coalesce step is i +1 as above, then 2, = 27,, and T,, = 77,, but
maybe C},, # C?,,. In subsequent steps k we use the same PPP outside
CiU C@ for each component, and therefore we have (rj, 24) = (7?, 23) for all
k >%+1. Each of the two component jump processes does evolve as the
EA process, except that for the first component process there is the extra
planted point at 2§. But this extra point only comes into play if it is the
exact point of coalescence, and so does not affect our arguments for upper
bounding the coalesce time.

A realization of six initial steps of the coupled process is illustrated in Figure
On the left are the successive positions 2}, Zu): Za): 23): 2lay in the first
component process, and on the right are the positions in the second compo-
nent process. The associated times for the first process are —tg < Tj = T) <
Td) < Tix) < Ta) < Tia and for the second process are 0 < TH = Ti) < TA) <
TO): Suppose that the times associated with these steps are ordered as

1 1 1 2 1 2
—to < Tio) < Tay < Ta) < To) < Ty) < Ti):

In terms of steps i of the coupled process (indicated in the figure as a, b,c, d,e, f)
we have

We will now relate how this description of the coupled EA process arises
as the description of the two lines of descent within the tree process for the
two given points of Z<,, and Z<o at positions zj and z2. Consider Figure
5} Inductively, we have traced back the two lines of descent to (-Ty: 2)
and (—Té), 2): using 6 steps of the coupled process. What happens next
depends on which of r/y or 7%) (that is, which of 7§ or 7) is smaller. Taking
the case Ty < To) (the other case is symmetric) then, to find the parent of

22
/n/n(—Tiy); 2) in the tree process, we need to search the region where vertices
may have arrived before —Ty; this excludes both Cy and the interior of
Ch): because the latter contains no particles arriving before —r?, and we
must have TC) < Ti) because of the rule that the component with smaller 7-
value expanded first. However the particle at 2) arrived at time —Téys which
was before time —1/,), and so is eligible to be the parent of (—T(4), 2(4)). So
the parent of (—Tiy); 2) is the closest particle to 2lay in the Poisson process
Zr: which has rate e~), on the complement of Cy U Cos or is 2) if
that particle is closer. In the latter case the two lines of descent coalesce at
(=T(); 2ay)-

In terms of steps i of the coupled process, 7/4, = T¢ and Ci U Ca) =
CG U CE and (—Té), 2%) = (-76, 26). This completes the derivation of the
evolution rule stated in section

To summarize:

=

Lemma 12. Condition on = containing particles €' and €? with ta <
to, tez <0 and (ze, 22) = (25, %). The joint process

((tparent{i,e1], Zparent|[i,é4]) tparent{i,£2]> Zparent[i,€2]) 0 < i< oo)

of arrival times and positions of the ancestors of these particles is distributed
as the random process ((—Tiy, Zi, —Tiy: Zi), 0 < t < 00) within the cou-
pled EA process ((C}, Z},7;);(C?, Z?,77), 0 < i < co) with initial states

({26}, 205 Toy) and ({zG}, 2, Toy) where To) +to and Ty) are independent with
Exponential(1) distribution.

As mentioned before, we write J.oa1 for the first step J such that 2} = 2
(and call that point Z.oa1), or equivalently for the first step J such that 7} = 77
(and call that time T’.1). We can now state the main result of section [3]

Proposition 13. There exist constants K,8 < oo and p > 0 such that, in
the coupled EA process above, for any (24,24) and any to > 0,

P(Teoa > t) < K exp(—pt) for all t > Blog* ||zj — ||. (27)

Heuristically we expect ||Zeoa — 24|| = exp(Tcoa/2) in the tails, and so
tail behavior of the form P(T.oai > t) < exp(—yt/2) would be equivalent to

23
/n/ntail behavior of the form P(||Zcoai|| > 7) < r77. We conjecture the latter is
true; precisely, that the exponent

log P Zeoal
yx = tin EPC |Zenall > 0)

2
roo logr (28)

exists and does not depend on ||zj — z2|| or to. This is closely related to the
“are boundaries fractal?” issue, as will be discussed in section [5.3}

For ease of exposition we will present the proof of Proposition [13 in the
case ty = 0. The general case requires only minor modifications, noted below.

3.2 The coalescence step

Here we will give conditions to ensure a non-vanishing probability of coalesc-
ing at the next step. This requires only a simple geometric lemma.

Lemma 14. Let 2,2) € R?, and let r,\ > 0. Let Z* be a Poisson point
process of rate X on R?. Then the event
the nearest point z € Z* to x is also the nearest point to z 2, and
min(||z — ||, ||z — zal|) >r
has probability at least

exp(—Aa(r + || 22 — 2:||)”) — 2eo"”"||20 — all (29)

for a certain absolute constant co.

Proof. Write d = ||z2 — 21||. Consider the events
(A): the distance from z, to the nearest point of Z* is at least r + d;
(B): the distances Dp” and DY from z to the nearest two points of Z*
are such that DY - Dp” < 2d.

We assert that, in order that the event in Lemma [14] occurs, it is sufficient
that the event (A) occurs and the event (B) does not occur. To prove this
assertion, let 2 be the closest point of Z* to 2, and let 24, be the closest
point of Z* to z). Suppose 2, 4 2}. By the triangle inequality

I|21 — 23|| < d+ |l22 — 25]] and |lz2 — || <a + lla — all
Because 2} is the closest point to 2
Il. — all < Ile — 2all-

24
/n/nCombining these three inequalities leads to
I|22 — AI — |l22 — || < 2d.

So if (B) fails then then z; = zi = z say. And so if (A) holds then, by the
triangle inequality, min(||z — z1||, |}z — zal|) > r-

The probability P(A) equals the first term in (29). It is easy to check tha
Dy? - DW) has a density bounded by some co, so (by scaling) the density of
D® — D® is bounded by coA¥2. So P(B) is at most 2coA!/2d.

We now apply this to the coalescence step.

Lemma 15. Consider a state (c!,c?) = ((C1, 21,71), (C?, 2*,7)) of the
coupled EA process started at z4 and z2. Suppose tT < 7?. Write A =
max(diam(C’), diam(C?). Then the probability that the process coalesces at
the next step is at least

1

exp(—4me~7 (|z4 — 22|| + 2A)?) — 2co|l2d — 22 |e" 2. (30)

Proof. Because 2) € C! and 2 € C?, we have
ll2" = 27II $ Ilzo — 2oll +20 =r

and moreover each disc(z’,r) contains C1 U C?. We can now apply Lemma
[14] with \=e-7: if the event in Lemmaf14] occurs then the process coalesces
at the next step.

3.3 Diameters in the coupled process

The key ingredient in proving Proposition is the following extension of

Proposition ig to the coupled EA process, which will enable us to apply

Lemma [15] This extension looks “obvious” but the proof is rather fussy.
Fix large b, and regard a step i of the coupled EA process as “good” if

e~™/? max(diam(C/), diam(C?)) < b. (31)

Let N,(T) be the number of “good” steps beford] time T.

Tn the general case to > 0 we only count the number of steps with 7} > 0.

25
/n/nProposition 16. In the coupled EA process, for sufficiently large b there
exist constants a,p > 0 and K < oo such that

P(Teoa > T, No(T) < aT) < K exp(—pT), 0< T < ov.

The bound does not depend on the distance ||z4 — z3|| between the par-
ticles.

In this section for an event indexed by T we say the event “has
vanishing probability” if the probabilities are O(exp(—pT)) as T’ — ov, for
some p> 0. As in Proposition [9] for 7 = 1,2 write

_ Joi
B Ueied2 diam(C?)>b} [as Ti ).
Note this is the same if use the indices Ty of the jump processes.
Write 7
N,(T) := Leb((B! U B?)* 1 (0, T)).

In words, this is the duration of time for which a “good” event similar to
is occurring. Applying Proposition [9] to both components of the coupled
process, for sufficiently large b

the event {Too > T, N,(T) < T'/3} has vanishing probability. (32)

This is almost what we are trying to prove as Proposition [16] except that we
need to switch from “duration of time” N,(T) to “number of steps” N;(T).

In the construction of the coupled EA process we can start with two
independent rate-1 PPPs on (0,00) and use these as the values of Ti) and Ti)
until the coalescence step. So on the event {Teoa1 > T} these times, within
[0,7], coincide with the times of two independent rate-1 PPPs. Here is a
helpful way to record a consequence of this fact]

Lemma 17. Let Br be an event defined in terms of two independent rate-1
PPPs on (0,T]. Let By be the corresponding event defined in terms of the
times Ty < Thy < Tay < +.» < T and Ty < Tay < Ta <.-. < T in the
coupled EA process. Then

P(Teoa > T, BE) < P(Br).

“The fact is slightly subtle, in that the previous assertion is not true conditional on the
event {Teoa > T}.

26
/n/nWe will apply this to events Br which have vanishing probability, in which
setting Lemma |17| says we can ignore such events for the purpose of prov-
ing Proposition We state the following straightforward large deviation
bounds for quantities associated with the PPP.

Lemma 18. Let (7;) be a rate-2 PPP on (0,00), let a > 0 and let Hy(a)
be the sum of the lengths of the |aT | longest intervals (7, Tiz1) with T < T.
Then, for sufficiently small a,

the event {Hr(a) > T/4} has vanishing probability. (33)

Lemma 19. Let (7;) be a rate-2 PPP on (0,00), represented as the superpo-
sition of two independent rate-1 PPPs. Define 7 as the minimum value of

T, for€ >k+2 such that the events at Th41.Th42,--.,T¢ include events from
both component processes. Define

Gr(a’) = Sotat —T 2 Te <T, 7 —T > a’t.
Then, for sufficiently large a’,
the event {Gr(a’) > T/12} has vanishing probability. (34)

Now choose a sufficiently small and a’ sufficiently large that inequalities
and hold. Write H7(a) and G7(a’) for the random variables cor-
responding (as in Lemma to Hy(a) and Gr(a’) defined in terms of the
times in the coupled EA process. Consider the event

{Teoa > T, Hila) < T/4, Ga’) < T/12, N,(T) > T/3}. (35)

On this event, take the “good” intervals comprising N,(T) (with total length
> T/3) and delete the intervals comprising G7(a’) (with total length <
T/12). There remain “good” intervals with total length > T/4, so there
are at least |aT'| such intervals. In other words, on event there are at
least |aT'| steps i of the coupled process such that

[7i, 7141) is disjoint from BtU B? and 7° < 7444’. (36)
For each such step i we have (see argument below),
e~7/? max(diam(C}), diam(C?)) < be®/? := 8, say. (37)

27
/n/nFigure 6: The times 7; of steps of the coupled process are shown on the axis.

The arrows point to the times Ti) and 72_., associated with the completed

steps of the component processes.

Wii

j) k—j+1)

In other words, on the event we have Ng(T) > |aT'|. So now
P(Teoa > T, Ng(T) < aT)
< P(Tooa > T, Hi(a) > T/A)
+ P(Teoa > T, Gh(a’) > T/12) + P(Teom > T, Ni(T) < T/3)
< ei > 7/4) + P(G3(a’) > T/12) + P(Tooa > T, N,(T) < T/3)

using Lemma Each term on the right has vanishing probability, by (32)

and (33) and ia, and a establishes Sa ake [16] (with 8 in place of b).

The argument that ee (37) is illustrated by the case in Figure

A Consider 7, = min(7;, *) = min (TG) 3)? Tih ;)) ) for some 7, and suppose that
as in the Figure) T > TCs )- Saying that

[Tes a is disjoint from B! U B?
is saying that
[7/)1):7()) is not in B’, and [7(,_;),7(4—741)) 18 not in B?
which is saying that
et)? diam(C}) < b and eo 7h s41)/? diam(C?,,) <b.

Now consider the first time after 7, that both components have expanded,
that is
qt = min{r : 7) > 7 and 77 > 7}.

28
/n/nThen the inequality above implies
ee? max(diam(C{), diam(CZ)) < b.

So when 7° < 7, +a’ we have (37).

3.4 Proof of Proposition

We need the following standard martingale-type bound.

Lemma 20. Let S > 1 be a stopping time for a filtration (Fn). For any
0<po<landm>1,

P(S > n) < (1— po)” + P(L(n, po) < m,S > n)

where
L(n, po) = |{i: 1< isn, P(S =i|F,4) > po}l-

Proof. The process (M,,) with Mo = 1 and, for n > 1,

M, = 0 on {S <n}
= on {S > n}

1
Thi<icn P(S>iF i-1)

is a martingale. On the event {L(n,po) > m,S > n} we have M,, > (1 —-
po)” and so

l= EM, > EM, 1(1(n,p9)>m,S>n) = (1 ~ po) "P(L(n, po) = Mm, S> n).
Because

P(S > n) = P(L(n, po) > m, S > n) + P(L(n, po) <m,S >n)

the result follows.

We can now combine previous ingredients to prove Proposition [13] Sup-
pose i is such that J¢oa > ¢ and the configuration (C};C?) satisfies (31).
Then by the probability of coalescing on the next step is at least

exp(—4m(||2g — zalle*/? + 2b)) — 2coll2g — zolle*”?.

29
/n/nSo there exist constants a > 0 and po > 0 (determined by b and co) such
that, for the natural filtration (F;) of the coupled EA process,

P(LIeoat = i+1|F;) > po on {Teoar > 4, ||24—z3||e-7”? < a, (Cl; C?) sacs (31)}.

Appealing to Lemma 20}
P(Leoa > 2) < (1 = po)” + P(Ln < m, Icoat > 2) (39)

where
In = |{t: OS ¢< n=-1, Pca = t+ 1|Fi) > po}|-

Recall the definition of N,(¢) in Proposition [16] Take a > 0 (to be specified
later) and consider some m < an. If

leg — 22|[e"/? < a for 7 = [an| —m (40)

then, on the event {Ico > n, Np(t) > an}, the events in (88) hold for at
least m values of i <n, which implies L, > m. So if holds then

P(Ln < m, Leo > 2) < P(Lcoar > 2, No(n) < an)
and then using we have

P(Leoa > 2) < (1=po)" +P(Lcoa > 2, No(n) < an)+P(Lcoa >, event (40) fails).

Proposition |16]implies that for sufficiently large b there exist constants a, p >
0 and kt < oo such that

P(Teoa > 2/3, Ny(n) < an) < K exp(—pn), n= 1,2,3,....
Using this choice of a above,
P(Leoat > 2) S (1 = po)” + Ocep (7)

+P(Leoat > 2; Teoat < 2/3) + PULcoar > mn, event (40) fails)

where O,,,(n) denotes a “vanishing probability” sequence which is O(p") as
n — oo for some p < 1. Now note that elementary large deviation bounds
for the rate-2 PPP (7;) show that

P(Leoa > 7; Teoar < r/3), PUcoa < 2, Teoa > 2), P(Tr < n/3) are all O.,,(n).
(41)

30
/n/nChoosing m = |an/2| we find
P(Leoat > 2) < Ocep(n) + P( event (40) fails), m = 1,2,3,...

where the O,,,(n) term does not depend on ||z) — ||. From the definition
of event and the choice of m

P( event (40) fails) < P(7; < 2log lleo=26ll) for j = |an/2] — 1. (42)
From the final term in there exists a constant @ such that
P( event (40) fails) = O.,,(n) for n > Blog* ||z4 — 2]|.
So now
P(Lcoat > 2) < Ovap(n) for n > Blog™ ||z5 — lI.

Because P(Tooa > 2) < P(Lcoa > 2) + P(Lcoar < n,Teoar > m) we have
established Proposition

In this section we use the preceding bounds to prove Theorems |1| and
Recall some definitions from section [1-1] M(R?) denotes the space of finite
measures on R?, equipped with the usual topology of weak convergence. For a

Note that given S<;,, the “marks” (Ji,1.,c, ¢ € Eee) are still random ele-
ments of the space M(R?), whose distributions depend on all =<;, and are
dependent as ¢ varies.

If we use Z<;, to define a translation-invariant marked PPP of the form
{(&,m*(&)),€ € Z<:} with non-negative real marks m*(€), then there is a
spatial average rate of mark values, which we will write as

ave(m*(€) : € € Ze)

31
/n/ndefined as the value of a such that

E > mt (€) =ax area(B), BCR’.

fect, EB

For instance we have, for t; < ta,

ave(| {44 ,t2,¢ : g € E<t,) =1 (44)
where || denotes the total mass of pu.

The self-similarity property of the underlying space-time PPP & allows us
to write down exact self-similarity properties for our marked point processes.
In particular, the action of the scaling map z > e~*/?z on R?, applied to the
distribution of {(2¢, /Mt,t2,¢), € € E<t,}, gives a distribution which coincides
with the distribution obtained from {(ze, fit, +1t0+14¢), € € E<t,44} under the
action of rescaling weights js > ety. These self-similarity properties allow us
to take previous results, which were stated in the context of time decreasing
from 0 to —t, and rewrite them in the context of time decreasing from t to 0
and in the notation above. These rewritten results and simple consequences
are recorded as Corollaries [21] — [23] below.

As a first example, Proposition [A] shows that for t > 0

ave(||Zancestor(—t,¢) — Zell : € € Exo) < Kell?
where K = to G(r)dr < co. Using self-similarity this implies
Corollary 21. For 0 < to < t,

ave(||Zancestor(to,é) _ 2¢|| : € € Ex) < Kele/?,

Next, the fact that a set of cardinality k contains k(k—1) ordered distinct
pairs gives the first identity below, and the second follows from self-similarity.
For t > 0

/n/nwhere 0 denotes the unit square and q(t; 21, z2) is the probability, given that
=<o has particles at z, and 2, that they have the same ancestor at time
—t. In the notation of Proposition [4] we have (using the triangle inequality)
q(t; 0, z) < 2G,(e~/?||z||/2). So from the conclusion of Proposition|4| we have

af q(t; 0, z)dz < ae | Glo" |/2)d2=2 | G(||z||/2)dz < co

Using for the —e’ term in we have established
Corollary 22. sup,.y ave(|Ho,,¢/?_ : ¢ € Z<o) < 00.
Finally, self-similarity allows us to rewrite Proposition {13} as follows.

Corollary 23. Let sy < § < 51 < 89. Let p(S9, $1, $2; 21, 22) be the probability,
given that Z<,, contains a particle at position ~ and Z<.s, contains a particle
at position 29, that these particles have different time-so ancestors. Then

P(S0, 81; 823 21, 22) < K exp(—p(8 — 80) provided ||2, — || < V2e~*?

for the constants K, p in Proposition[Z3) .

4.2 Convergence of mark measures
Here we will prove

Proposition 24. There exist M(R*)-valued marks (poo, ¢ € E<o) such
that ave(|Ho,00,c|; ¢ € Z<o) = 1 and for all ¢ € E<o

Ho,t,¢ + Ho,oo,¢ in probability as t —+ oo.

The argument is slightly subtle: we cannot directly compare jup,z,,¢ and
H0,t2,¢ because the relative numbers of time-tz descendants of different time-
t, ancestors are different (as in a supercritical branching process), so the
measure on time-t,; descendants derived from the uniform measure on time-
ty descendants is not uniform. Instead we first prove convergence of total
masses.

Proposition 25. There exist real-valued marks (moc, ¢ € E<o) such that
ave(mo,¢: ¢ € E<o) = 1 and for all ¢ € E<o

|Ho,,c| + Mo,¢ in probability as t + oo.

33
/n/nProof. Write O for the unit square and H(t) for the scaled square of area e~*.

For 0 < ty < ty < tg and ¢ > 0 write A(to, ti, t2,€) for the event

ti—to

there exist at least (1 — e)e particles of E<;, in O(tp), and
at least (1 — e)e!2~ particles of Z<;, in O(to), all with the same
time-0 ancestor.

Define

p(to, €) = lim inf lim inf P(A (fo, t1, ta, €)). (46)
ti-co—tz-400
We will show
Lemma 26. lim,,).0 p(to,€) = 1 for each e > 0.

Granted that, consider
a(ty, tz) := ave( min( |Hoz.,cl , |éots,cl ), ¢ € E<o) <1.
By averaging over area-ty squares in R?,
a(ti,t2) > (1 — e€)P(A(to, ti, te, €)).
So Lemma [26] implies

lim inf lim inf a(t1, t2) = 1. (47)

tioo ote

By the triangle inequality and 4.

ave(| |Ho,tu.cl — |Hotecl |: ¢ € Exo) < 2a(t, te).

Then and the Cauchy criterion imply there exist limits mo¢ for which
lim ave(| |Hoz,c] — moe |: ¢ € S<o) =0.
too

Finally, Corollary [22] provides the “uniform integrability” condition needed
(0 pass to the limit to obtain ave(mo¢ : ¢ € S<o) = 1. This establishes

Proposition
Oto

Proof. [of Lemma26| Write Ee; ) for the restriction of E<; to particles within
(to). We can upper bound the mean number of pairs (€, 2) in O(¢o) with
& € S<;, and with different time-0 ancestors, as follows. Write

M(to, th, ty) = > > L fancestor(0,é1)Zancestor(0,f2)}

~o =o
Sona eS ot0)

34
/n/nThen
EM (to, ti, t2) = ee” / / p(0, ti, te, 21, 22) dzdz
O(to) 4O(to)

where p(0, t1, te, 21, 22) is the probability, given that E<;, has a particle at 2
and Z<;, has a particle at z2, that these two particles have different time-0
ancestors. But Corollary [23] shows that when z; and z are in (to) we have
p(0, t1, ta, 21, 22) < K exp(—pto). So

EM (to, ti, tz) < e+” K exp(—pto). (48)

We now quote an elementary lemma.

Lemma 27. Let I C J be finite sets, let ~ be an equivalence relation on J
and let B be a maximal-cardinality set in the corresponding partition of J.

Let
Md Px + iD
[Z| - |F\ 2 :
Then |BNI| > (1— p)|L| and |BN(J\ D| > A- p)|F\ LI.

We will apply the lemma with J and J being aa and Ba), so that
|I| and |J| have Poisson distributions with means e"~'° and e”~, and to
the equivalence relation “same time-0 ancestor”. Choose 6 > 0 such that
(1 — 6)(1 — 6(1 — 6)~?) < e. On the event

|Z| > (1—d)e"—® and |J| > (1—d)e2~ and M(to, ti, te) < de (49)

Lemma|27]implies that event A(to, ti, t2,€) holds. The first two events in
have probabilities — 1 as t1, tg — oo, and so by and Markov’s inequality
the limit p(to,€) at satisfies

p(to,€) > 1—6-'K exp(—pto),

establishing Lemma

Proof of Proposition [24] Take 0 < to < ¢. By self-similarity, Proposition
25]remains true if time 0 is replaced by an arbitrary time to: there exist real-
valued marks (mie, € € Z<i,) such that for all € € Bey,

|H1o,t,¢| —* Mt,¢ in probability as t > oo. (50)

35
/n/nFor ¢ € E<o define 4p 49,¢ to be the measure that puts weight m;,¢ on the
position ze of each particle € € Descend(0,to,¢). And define 19 4,4,¢ to be
the measure that puts weight |/,7,¢| on the position ze of each particle € €
Descend(0, to, ¢). We will need to show that, for large to, the measures 1 ,4,1,¢
and jo,,¢ are close.

We exploit the dual bounded Lipschitz metric on M(R?):

d(v,v') =sur{| [ar f par

I[fllax = max (swish sup a)
z zy Az2

: |Ifllax < i}

This metric has the property

(Loew) <eS° lz - zl. (51)

Consider 0 < t; < tg < t. The relationship between voi. 4¢ and Vos, 2¢ is
that for each € € Descend(0,t,¢) the weight e~' moved from the position of
ancestor(tz,€) to the position of ancestor(t,€). Taking spatial averages and
using (51) we find

e ave(| | Zancestor(t1,€) — Zancestor(t2,€) \|, g € Ee)

2Ke"? by Corollary 21

ave(d(Vo,t1,,¢5%,t2,,¢)) 6 € Exo) <
<

This and are sufficient to imply that the v’s have a limit: for all ¢ € E<o
Yo.t,¢ > Ho,co,¢(Say), in probability as t + oo. (52)

Now by we can write the definition of 19 49,¢ as
Yotog = YA (lim |Miouel)5eg + € € Descend(0, to, ¢)}
whereas (by definition) for t > to

Ho,t.¢ = Stone : € € Descend(0, to, ¢)}-

36
/n/nSo now we have

A(tot,¢; Ho,c0,¢) <  A(Yo.to.¢; Ho.co,¢) + A(Ho,t,¢; Y0,t0.¢)
S  d(Yoto,¢; Ho,c0,¢) + Di {d( tim, |e Sees Hto,t,¢) + € € Descend(0, to, ¢)}

+S 2 {d(Mione + \Mto.teldze) : € € Descend (0, to, ¢)}.

Taking the spatial average over ¢ € E<o of sums over all time-tp descendants
of ¢ is the same as taking the spatial average over all time-to particles. So
taking averages in the inequality above gives

ave(d(o,1,c; H0,00,¢) : ¢ € E<0) < bi (to) + bo(to, t) + b3(to, t) (53)

where
bi(to) = ave(d(vo,10,c; [40,00,¢) : ¢ € E<o)
ba(to,t) = ave (| lim |dinel — [Monel | + € € Et)
bs(to,t) = ave(d(tiote > [Mtoteloec) + € € Bcto):

To prove Proposition [24] it is enough to prove
ave(d(10,4,¢; H0,00,¢) 1 ¢ € E<o) 4 0 as t > oo. (54)

We know bi(to) + 0 as to + 00 by (52). And 62(0,t) + 0 as t + oo by
Proposition [25] and then by self-similarity b2(to,t) > 0 as t > oo for all to.
Finally,

Alpineg » Wtoselbse) Sf llee~=ll toee(d)

and so
b3(to,t) < e~' avel||Zancestor(—to,v) — 2xI| = xX € Exe)

Now taking limits in the inequality establishes and then Proposition
24

37
/n/n4.3. The random partition

We will now show that a limit random measure [ip,o0,¢ in Proposition [24] is in
fact Lebesgue measure A restricted to some random set. The fact that the
t — oo limit normalized empirical measure on Z; is A implies that

So {lo,s0.¢ [CE E<o} =Aas. .

So the random measures /o,.0,¢ have random densities fc(z), z € R® such
that

YLFe(2) :C€ Eeof =1Vz as.
As t + co we have

EL) DS eo Lieg, zeit) 1 € Bet, & € Bart > Ff bss-saen daydzy

ze, €0 2, <0

Now consider whether a pair (£1, 2) have different time-0 ancestors; precisely,
consider

jim E{ > > CL illee, eg IIS} L fancestor(0,é1)#ancestor(0,£2)} : ‘I € Fer, €2 € Be}
ze, €0 2%, €0

(55)
From the fact s10,,¢ + Ho,oo,¢ the limit in equals

E Lf tivs--ieo 1- > fela)felza) | dzrdz. (56)

CEE <o

But consider the probability p(0, t,t, 1, z2), given that E<; has particles at
2 and 2g, that they have different time-0 ancestors. By Corollary [23] with
defined by 6//2 = exp(—s/2),

if ||22 — 21|| < 6 then p(0, t,t, 21, 22) < K6°? for t > 5.

So the limit in also equals

ff ruamaien lim p(0, t,t, 21, 22) dzidzq < Ko | / 14 \/21-22|| <6} dzdzq.

(57)

/n/nFor probability distributions (a;) and (b;) we have 1— }3, a,b; > 1— max; a.
Applying this to and using inequality (57),

Letting 6 | 0 we deduce that as.

So defining

A(0,¢) = {2: fel2) = 1
and modifying on null sets, the random sets {A(0,¢) : ¢ € E<o} form a
partition of R?, and jW9,00,¢ is Lebesgue measure restricted to A(0,¢). So
writing A, for Lebesgue measure restricted to A, we can rewrite Proposition
as follows, using self-similarity to extend from the time-0 case to the
general time t case.

Proposition 28. For each —oo < t < oo there exists a random partition
{A(t,6) :¢ € Zr} of R? into measurable sets such that for all € € By

Htuc + Nawc in probability as u— oo.

4.4 Completing the proofs

Proposition 28]is essentially enough to prove Theorems [2] and[I] As noted in
the introduction, for fixed t we can regard

ZL = {(x, A(t,€)): €€ Zar}

as a marked point process. The fact that the evolution of the coloring process
after time t, given Z;, does not depend on the arrival times of the particles in
=<, means that Z is measurable with respect to the time-reversed filtration

=
Fat bh. The statement in Theorem |1| was that the process Z“ evolves in
reversed time according to the rule:

during [t,t — dt], for each € € Ex, delete € (that is, remove the
entry (ze, A(t,)) ) with probability dt; for each deleted particle
€, let ¢ be the nearest other particle, and set A(t — dt,¢) =
A(t, ¢) U A(t, €).

39
/n/nTo see how this arises, fix large T and for —oo < t < T consider {(z¢, /u,r¢) :
€ € S<;} as a marked point process. From Lemma} (the thinning property of
the PPP), in reversed time ¢ this evolves precisely as a “coalescing measures
process” :

during [t,t — dt], for each € € Ex, delete € (that is, remove the
entry (Ze, /4,r,¢)) with probability dt; for each deleted particle €,
let ¢ be the nearest other particle, and set py—air¢ = Marc +Here-

Taking the T’ > oo limit given in Proposition we obtain the former rule
for the dynamics of Z.

The other assertions of Theorem |1| hold by translation-invariance and
self-similarity of the underlying space-time PPP &.

/n/n5 Discussion

5.1 In what sense is this a tree process?

We have used the language of ancestors and descendants, but otherwise have
not really exploited the implicit tree structure of the colored point process
construction. If we draw the process as a random tree in the plane, with
edges drawn as line segments, it is clear from Figure [I] that edges sometimes
cross, so we do not get a “tree” in the usual sense. This suggests that,
in the opening “k colors in the unit square” model, in the limit partition
into k colored regions, these regions are not necessarily connected. Figure [?|
illustrates how this could happen. Simulations strongly indicate that in fact
a typical region is not connected but that only a very small proportion of its
area is outside its largest connected component.

Figure 7: A possible realization of the tree in the unit square on the first
n = 11 arriving points. The edge from 1 to 2 is omitted, to show the k = 2
subtrees associated with the first two vertices. At this stage the unit square
is Voronoi-partitioned into 2 components according to whether the nearest
vertex is o or e, and the o component is not connected. We expect this
disconnection to persist in the n — oo limit.

41
/n/n5.2 Other models of coalescing partitions

There has been very little study of partition-valued processes in the plane
which evolve by merging of adjacent components. One such process can be
obtained by thinning a Poisson line process, but we are thinking of pairwise
mergers. A well-studied implicit example is provided by bond percolation.
As illustrated in Figure |8| to a percolation cluster of “open” edges (A) one
can associate (this is planar duality) the region consisting of the union of the
unit squares centered at the the vertices in the cluster (B), and then delete
the open edges (C) and vertices to obtain a partition of the plane (D). The
length of the boundary between two adjacent regions in this partition equals
the number of “closed” edges between the original percolation clusters. So
in the bond percolation model where edges become open at Exponential(1)
times, the associated partition-valued process is such that the merger rate
of adjacent regions equals the length of their common boundary. For this
model classical percolation theory [10] implies that infinite regions appear
after time log2. More general models in which two adjacent components
merge into one at some stochastic rate determined by their geometry are
discussed in [1], where it is conjectured that if large components do not grow
too quickly (relative to small components) then there should be some self-
similar asymptotics, but no such result is proved. The coalescing partitions
process in this paper is perhaps the only known self-similar Markovian process
of pairwise merging partitions of R?. In one dimension, the thinning process
of Poisson points defines a self-similar process of merging adjacent intervals,
which has an interpretation as intermediate-size asymptotics in the Kingman
coalescent ({4] section 3.1).

5.3 Heuristic arguments

Arguments in this section are heuristics, only parts of which seem easily
formalized. We conjectured at (28) that the tail behavior of the “meeting
distance” random variable ||Zcoai|| is of the form

P(||Zeoai|| > 17) X r77 as r 4 co (58)

for some exponent y. This is heuristically related to the issue of fractal
dimension of the boundaries of the regions (A(0,), € € E<o), as follows.
Consider the boundaries within the unit square. Saying this has fractal
dimension d is saying that for small 2 > 0 we need order a~@ radius-x discs

43
/n/nto cover these boundaries. Consider a uniform random point z; in the square
and another random point z2 uniform on disc(z:, 2). The chance that z, and
Zq are in different components is the same order as the chance they are in the
same covering disc, which chance is order x?~¢. But the former chance is the
same order as the chance that the meeting distance MM, between their lines
of descent is at least 1, that is P(M,, > 1). So we expect P(M, > 1) x a?~¢
as x | 0. Now by self-similarity M, =q 7M,. So setting r = 1/x

P(M, >r)xr-e9 (59)
and we heuristically identify the fractal dimension as

d=2-y7.

5.3.1 Heuristic 1: the boundary has fractal dimension 1

For large to consider the Voronoi regions associated with the different sets of
particles Descend(0, to, ¢) as ¢ varies. The particles in =<, are separated by
distance of order e~*°/?. Consider three points (21, 22, 23) on the boundary at
‘ime tg at distances of (say) 5e~'*/? apart. As ¢ increases, particles arriving
nearby move the boundary near these three points. The first such move is
over a distance of order e~*?/? and subsequent moves decrease geometrically.
So in the t > oo limit the positions of the boundaries near (21, 22, z3) should
ecome (2, + Dye7"/?, zy + Dye~/?, z3 + Dze~/?) for some (D1, Dz, D3)
with a non-vanishing limit as tg + oo. But this is saying that in the limit
partition (A(0,¢),¢ € =<o), on every scale o = ||y: — ys||, for y: and ys on
she boundary, the distance from the midpoint (y; + y3)/2 to the boundary
is of the form Do for some random D > 0. This is a hallmark of “fractal
dimension = 1”.

5.3.2 Heuristic 2: the boundary has fractal dimension 1

The genealogical tree defines a “line of descent” for each particle in &; these
particle positions are dense in R?, so let us suppose that in the continuum
limit there is such a “line of descent” from almost all points z of R? to
infinity. Draw the tree via line segments in R?. Consider a point (2,0) on
the x-axis. The route from there to infinity first crosses the y = 1 line at
some random point (c(x),1). Consider the random set C of all such values
c(x) as a varies. This is stationary (translation-invariant) and so has some

44
/n/nintensity y, which cannot be zero; moreover we expect y < oo because the
intensity of line segments of length > a is finite for each a > 0. Then suppose
that for each c € C, the sets of originating points {x : c(x) = c} form som
interval (x_(c), x4(c)).

Next consider, for z > 0, the random quantity defined as

the infimum of y > 0 such that the routes from (1,0) to infinity
and from (a; + z,0) to infinity first hit the line {(x,y) : —oo <
x < co} at the same point.

This has a distribution, say D,, which does not depend on 21. By considering
endpoints of the intervals (a_(c),7+(c)) we have

y= lim P(Ds > 1)/6.

But by scale-invariance we have Ds =q 6D,, and so
P(D, > d)~y/dasd> ow.

But D, should have the same tail behavior as Mj, at 9). This suggests the
scaling exponent is y = 1 and hence the fractal dimension of the boundaries
=1.

5.3.3 Heuristic 3: the boundary has fractal dimension # 1

The heuristics at are essentially saying that the fractal dimension d
is determined via the limit

lim P(\|Zeoail| > 21) — 94-2.

reo P({|Zeoail| > 7)
But the limit is determined by the asymptotics of the coupled EA process,
conditioned on not coalescing for a long time. As we saw in in section [3.1
the dynamics of the coupled EA process involve the complicated geometry
of excluded regions, and there seems no reason why that limit should turn
out to be exactly 1/2.

5The argument is unchanged if instead it is a union of a finite-mean number of intervals.

45
/n/n5.3.4 Regarding Conjecture [3]

One might imagine that Conjecture |3] would follow easily from Proposition
[13] via some general result of the form

If {A, A°} is a partition of the unit square such that p(r) > 0
as r — 0, where p(r) is the probability that two random points
at distance r apart are in the same subset, then (after modifying
A on a set of measure zero) the topological boundary of A has
measure zero.

But this assertion is not true in general, by considering an example of the
form A = U; disc(z;, r;) for dense (z;) and r; | 0 very fast. Proving Conjecture

[3] seems to require some new argument.
