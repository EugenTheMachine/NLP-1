/n/n1 Introduction

The notion of effective field theories (EFT) is central to modern particle physics both at the

conceptual level and as a calculationa’

tool. In particular the large range of quark masses in nature

invites the EFT construction. If the quarks are very light as compared to the typical scales, their

masses effectively become irrelevant
interactions in this limit acquires ac
effective low-energy theory described

their masses again become irrelevan'

and can be treated as a perturbation; the theory of strong

ditional chiral symmetry and can be matched to an
by chiral Lagrangian. Similarly, if the quarks are very heavy,

. Heavy quarks in loops decouple whereas heavy quarks in

initial and final states move along their classical trajectories and can be thought of as sources of an

external Coulomb field. The corresponding EFT — the Heavy

is well established and contributec
Model.

Gauge theories can have “hidden” symmetries that are not seen at the Lagrangian level.
particular, it turns out that the renormalization group equations (RGEs) in QCD are integrable

/n/n2 General remarks

2.1 Renormalization Group Equations in HQET

For our discussion the two-component spinor formalism is the most convenient. We write the Dirac
spinor as

Ya - 8
q=|_3]. d= (x", va) (2.1)
%
and decompose the gluon field strength in terms of chiral and antichiral symmetric tensors fag
and Fao

Fugag = Toa Tgpt uv = 2 (cas fas - cashes) (2.2)

which belong to (1,0) and (0,1) representations of the Lorenz group, respectively.
Twist decomposition is usually done by a projection on a pair of auxiliary light-like vectors

n? = 0, 7? = 0 which can be represented by a product of auxiliary spinors

Naa = Ny04, = ora Rod = Myo, = baba (2.3)
where \ = Al, fi= pi. The “+” and “” fields are defined as
XE = AMo, UE =A Ya, fe = AM fos, fe = AHP fos, fee =A" Fxg (2-4)

etc. The effective heavy quark field of HQET h, can be represented by a Wilson line in a timelike
direction v = (1/2)(n +7), v? = 1 with an attached free Dirac spinor so that [24]:

0

(0|/.(0)|h, v) = [0, -vo0] = Pexp ia /

—oo

da u.AM(on)| . (2.5)

The equation of motion (EOM) #h, = hy implies for the two-component spinors

hy =—h_, h_=h,. (2.6)

In this work we will be dealing with renormalization of gauge-invariant operators built of a
heavy quark and light quark/gluon fields at lightlike separations (“light-ray operators”). The

simplest operator in question is

- 1
O+(z, w) = v+(zn)[zn, O]A+(0) , [zn, 0] = Pexp liv f da ny At(azn)| . (2.7)

Thanks to (2.5) this operator can be viewed as a single light antiquark attached to the Wilson line
with a cusp containing one lightlike and one timelike segment. Its matrix element between vacuum
and HQET meson state defines what is called a leading twist heavy-meson (e.g. B-meson in static
limit) distribution amplitude (DA) in position space

H0|O4(2, #)|B(o)) ~ (251). (2.8)
/n/nThe DA ®+(z;,1) is an analytic function of the light-cone separation z in the lower half of the
complex plane. Its scale dependence is driven by the RGE for the operator O4(z, j4), which has
the form

0 Oo asc
(: 15, + Blo) + Fyn) Onl) = 0, (2.9)

where the evolution kernel Hg, (the heavy-light “Hamiltonian” ) is an integral operator [25-27]

Here 0), = 1/2 and og = 3/4 are the heavy and light quark anomalous dimensions, respectively. In
what follows we imply using dimensional regularization with minimal subtraction (MS-scheme).
It was noticed [28] that this operator can be written in a simpler form in terms of the generator
of special conformal transformations

Hah In(iuS}) + YE — On — Oq- 2.11

Thus Hg, and St = 270, + 2z share the same eigenfunctions

iSy Qs(z) = 8 Qs(z) , Hah Qs(z) [n(u s) + YE — Oh o| Qs(z) 2.12

providing the complete set of solutions for the RGE (2.9).
In the description of heavy baryons and also of higher Fock states in heavy mesons, more
complicated operators arise that involve more than one light degree of freedom, of the type

ven n)p+(zon)h4(0),
x4 (ain) f+ (zon)h+ (0) ,
wale). (zan)h_(0), (2.14)

etc., where we suppress color structure and the gauge links. The “Hamiltonians” appearing in the
RGEs for such operators to one loop accuracy have a pairwise structure, e.g.

Hagh = Hag + Hah + Hoh , (2.15)

where the “heavy-light” two-particle evolution kernels have the form similar to (2.11) with the
generators in the appropriate representation, and the “light-light” ones can be written in terms of
the corresponding quadratic Casimir operators [29]. Explicit expressions can be found, e.g., in [19].

It turns out [17-19] that these more complicated RGEs are completely integrable and can be
solved using QISM techniques. In this work we construct and discuss the corresponding spin chain
models which differ somewhat from the standard ones and may be interesting in other applications.
/n/n2.2 Spin chain models

The RGE kernels in HQET of the type (2.15) can be identified with the Hamiltonians of certain
spin chain models with SL(2, R) Oa gi These models describe quantum mechanical systems

of interacting spins, si) = ts er) "gi }, which are the generators of SL(2,IR). The index
k =1,...,N enumerates the sites of the chain, where the number N corresponds to the number of

light degrees of freedom. The spin operators on a given site k obey standard commutation relations

[s®, 9) = +5, [s®, 9] = a5 (2.16)

and commute with each other for k 4 k’. The generators can conveniently be realized as the first
order differential operators

sP= = 20x, + 228k, sy? = 20x, + 8k; so = — dz, - 2.17)

The spin s; labels a representation of the SL(2,R) group. The choice of the representation depends
on the problem under consideration. In statistical physics one usually encounters spin chains with
finite dimensional representations, while in QFT one deals with infinite dimensional representations.
In the present context we need the so-called discrete series representation of SL(2,R) group,
D5 [30]. It is defined on the space of functions analytic in the lower half-plane and equipped with
the scalar product [30]

(f.9)s = / Daz (F(2))*al2); 2.18)

/n/n3 Heavy-light spin chain models

3.1 Closed spin chain

3.1.1 Monodromy matrix

The QISM approach allows one to construct a set of mutually commuting operators (charges) for
spin chain models as follows. One defines the so-called Lax operator

5 9

Ly (u) =uti ( 0 (3.1)

s® —s\?

where the spectral parameter u is a complex number. The monodromy matrix is defined as a

product of the Lax operators

Ty (u) = Ly (uy) L2(uz)... Ly (uy) = (2x ot) ; (3.2)

with uz, = u+ &, where the €% are the so-called impurities and we assume s; = s unless stated
otherwise. By construction, the entries of the monodromy matrix are polynomials in the spectral

parameter u. It can be shown that these operators form commuting families [7], i.e.
[An(u), An(v)] =0, [By(u), Bn(v)] =0, [Cn(u),Cn(v)] =0, [Dn(u),Dn(v)] =0. (3.3)

Since [Sq + 0/2, T(u)] = 0 where a4 are the Pauli matrices and Sy = a Ss ig the operator
of total spin, it is easy to show that

(So, An] = [So, Dw] = 0, [S-, Bw] =[S+,Cn] =0,

[S+,Dy] = —[S4, An] = Cn, [S_, An] = —[S_, Dy] = By. (3.4)

In the familiar field-theory applications such as the RG equations for light-ray operators built of
light quarks/gluons in QCD, one deals with the SL(2,R) invariant systems. For such systems the

proper object to consider is the transfer matrix,
tw(u) = An(u) + Dn(u), tw(u), tw(v)] = 0, (3.5)
which is an invariant operator, [Sa,tw(u)] = 0. It turns out that the transfer matrix of a

homogeneous chain without impurities commutes also with the (Hamiltonian) operator

N

Hy = SO Hees ; Hers = 2((Jer+1) + Ye) — 204, (3.6)
k=l

where 7(x) is the polygamma function and J;;,41 is the two-particle operator of conformal spin,
Teens (Feezi — 1) = (5 4 SAPD), (3.7)

The operator Hy can be identified with the leading-order evolution kernel for certain RGEs in
gauge theories [4]. Since Hy commutes with ty(w) they share the same set of eigenfunctions which
can be constructed with the help of QISM |7, 10].
/n/n3.1.2 Heavy-light Hamiltonian

The main new element in the present case is that the evolution kernels in HQET are not SL(2, R)
invariant. It was shown, however, that at leading order all heavy-light kernels commute with the
generator S, of special conformal transformations [27]. Since [S4, Cw] = 0 (3.4) it is natural to
expect that the conserved charges (if there is any hidden symmetry) in the heavy-light sector have
to be generated by the Cy(u)-entry of the monodromy matrix. An example of such a system is
given by the heavy-light baryon [31-33] corresponding to a two-site chain and first studied in [17].
Motivated by this application, we consider from now on a homogeneous (s; = s) closed spin chain
without impurities (€, = 0), but with an arbitrary number of sites N.
As the first step, we show that the Hamiltonian
N-1
Hy =H, + > Hirt + Hn . (3.8)
k=1

where Hyz+1 are defined in (3.6) and the boundary Hamiltonians are given by!
H,=In (ius?) +E, Hy =I|n (ius?) +yYE, (3.9)

commutes with the Cy(u)-entry of the monodromy matrix. This statement follows almost

immediately from the relation [34]
[Hrepis Le(u)Lesi(u)) = i(Ln(u) — Lesi(u)) , 3.10)
which is a consequence of the defining RLL relation for the R-operator [7],

Rio(u — v)Ly(u)Lo(v) = Lo(v) Li (u)Ri2(u — v), 3.11)

and its small-u expansion: Rjo(u) = Pr(t — wHyg + O(u?)). Here Pj, is the permutation
operator, Piaf (21,22) = f(z2, 21). In addition, [So, In $,] = 1 implies that

Ky = [ms L,(u)] = - (; ‘) ; Ky = (nS), Ly(w)] = -i (; ‘) ; 3.12)

Using (3.10) and (3.12) one easily finds

N-1
[ So Mansa, Tv(w)] = -iLe(u) -. Ly(u) + ia (uw). Lya(w) (3.13)
k=1
and
(Ha, Ty (u)] = ky L2(u) wee Lyn(u) 5 (Hy, Ty (u)| = Iy(u) wee Ly_-i(u)Kn. (3.14)

Adding up all terms one verifies that indeed

[Hy, Ty (u)Jo1 = (Hy, Cy (u)] = 0. (3.15)

‘In this discussion we omit trivial constants corresponding to the quark wave-function renormalization, cf. (2.11).
/n/nIt is convenient to consider the operator By(u) instead of Cy(u) at the intermediate steps,
using the fact that they are unitarily equivalent: The inversion operator J (which is an unitary
operator) intertwines Cy (u) and By(w). The inversion operator is defined as

[Jfl(2) = 2-**f(-1/2), FIP = INP, (3.16)

where ||f||? = (f, f)s. It intertwines the generators, JS9 = —SoJ, JS: = —SyJ, and asa
consequence the following relation for the monodromy matrix holds:

ITn(u)J71 = o2Tn(u)o2, (3.17)
where go» is the Pauli matrix. Comparing the off-diagonal entries in this relation one gets
JCn(u) = —By(u)J. (3.18)

Thus Cy(u) and By(u) are indeed unitarily equivalent and their eigenfunctions are related to
each other by inversion. The Hamiltonian (3.8) transforms under inversion into

N-1
Hy=JHyJ7! = Hy + > Here + Hn, (3.19)
k=1

where Hn) =In ( - ipsl™) + Ye.

Eigenfunctions of the operator By(u) provide the basis for Sklyanin’s representation of
separated variables. They have been constructed explicitly in [35] and are given by the product of
layer operators acting on the exponential function. For the homogeneous chain considered here

Wp ay(21,---2n) = An (@1)An-1(#2)...Ao(ay—i)ew””,, 3.20

Here and below w = w*. The layer operator Ayy can be visualized as the diagram shown in Fig. 1
where a directed line from w to z with an index a stands for the “propagator” D(z, w) and the
a and £ indices take the values s — ix and s + ix, respectively. A summary of the properties of
the layer operators can be found in [36] (see also Sec. 4). We mention here that Vype,.ey_

with respect to the scalar product (2.18) for different sets, 7 #2.

The eigenfunctions of the operator By(w) (3.20) diagonalize the Hamiltonian Hy (3.19). The

corresponding eigenvalues can be found either with the help of QISM machinery that involves

construction of the relevant Baxter-Q operators, see e.g. [37, 38], or by a a more brute-force
approach described below. To this end we notice that in the region z1 > zg >... > zn, ie.
\zn41/2| = O(e), € > 0, the eigenfunction (3.20) is simplified to a linear combination of “plane
waves”

the separated variables 71,...,2,_1. Action of the Hamiltonian (3.19) on the eigenfunction (3.26)
can be brought to a more convenient form using the following identities [22, 28, 38]:

In(id,) = w(—z0-) — In(iz), In(iz?0,) = u(zd-) + In(iz). (3.27

The “bulk” Hamiltonians can be written as Heey1 = hkjk+i + he+i,0 where [39, 40]

hw = U( Zin Oe + 28) — WL). (3.28
These expressions can be simplified in the chosen kinematics as

het = Y(zrOn + 28) — ¥(1) + Ole),
hgh = In(iz) + W(—Zp410K41) _ w(1) _ In(ize41) + O(e) : (3.29)
/n/nThe last identity can be obtained as follows

Inizpoip + In 2% + In(iOp41) + O(6)

Thus, in the chosen region |2,41/zx| = O(c), the Hamiltonian Hy takes the form

N-1
Hy (b(—2.z) + (ze, + 28) — 20b(1)) + 2In(ipOy) — 24(1) + O(6), (3.31)

from which one immediately reads the eigenvalue from Eq. (3.26)

Ey ag = 2In(pp) — 2(1) 4 (ie + ixp) + W(s — ixp) 2u(1)) . (3.32)

The special case considered in [17] (heavy baryons) corresponds to s = 1, N = 2. In this case one
obtains (in a certain convenient normalization)

I ay tx

and
Ey = 2In(up) + W(1 + ix) + Y(1 — ix) + 4y Rp — 20n — 404, (3.34)

where we have added the constant term corresponding to the (light and heavy) field anomalous
dimensions.

Finally, one has to perform an inversion transformation z — —1/z (3.16) in order to go back to
the original problem with the Hamiltonian commuting with C2(u), and obtain the wave function,

Vpal21, 22) 2 Dp e(z1,22) [17]

notation of [17]) becomes an eigenvalue of the generator of special conformal transformations

(si) + 82) ®p0(a,22) = —tp pc (21, 22)- (3.36)

The functions (3.35) define the basis of states for the heavy-light baryon DAs with autonomous
scale dependence (for the case of aligned light-quark helicities), where z; and 22 are the light-
quark light-cone coordinates. The energies (3.34) are nothing but the corresponding anomalous
dimensions.

/n/n3.2 Open spin chains

A systematic approach to construct integrable models with nontrivial boundary conditions (open

spin chains) was developed by Sklyanin [41]. The monodromy matrix for such systems is given by

the following expression ?

Tw(u) = (-1)% Tr (u)o2T 4 (—u)o2 = (es aay ; 3.37

where Ty (u) is the monodromy matrix of the closed spin chain (3.2), Ti(u) is the transposec
matrix. It can be written in terms of the Lax operators as follows:

Tw(u) = Li(u)Lo(u)... Ly (u) Ln (wu)... Lo(u)Li(u). 3.38
This representation can easily be obtained using the identity
(Lp(u))! = —ogLy(—u)oo. 3.39

Off-diagonal elements of the monodromy matrix satisfy the following relations (see e.g. [42])

(—2u + 1) By(—u) = (2u +7) By(u), (—2u + 1) Cy(—u) = (Qu+ 7) Cy(u). 3.40

As a consequence, the operators By(u) and Cy(u) vanish at wu = i/2 and can be represented as
By(u) = (—2u +2)By(u) and similarly for Cy(u). The operators with a “hat” are even functions
of u, By(u) = By(—u), Cx (u) = Cn(—u). These operators and the transfer matrix,

tw(u) = An(u) + Dy(u), tn(u) = ty(—u), 3.41)

form commuting operator families *

[By (u),By(v)] = [Cw(w),Cx(v)] = [tx(u), tw(v)] = 0. 3.42)

Our aim is to construct a Hamiltonian which commutes with Cy(u) (or with By(u)). Let us
consider at first the homogeneous spin chain. In this case using the representation in (3.38) for the
monodromy matrix and the relation in (3.10), it is easy to find that the commutator of the bulk
Hamiltonian

N-1

Hy = 0 Hees, Harp = 2(Versi) — 0); (3.43)
k=l

and the monodromy matrix reads

[Hy, Tx (u)] = —tLo(u)... Ly (uw) Ly (u)... Ly (u) + ily (u)... Ly (u) Ly(u)... L2(u)
= i[L1(u),Ty-i(u)], (3.44)

Our definition differs from the standard one, Ty(u) = Tn(u)Ty'(—u +4), by a numerical factor.
3Note that in distinction with the closed spin chains diagonal elements of the monodromy matrix for open spin
chains do not commute.

11
/n/nwhere Ty_i(u) = Lo(u)...Ln(u)Ly(u)...L2(u). Taking the trace over the auxiliary space in
(3.44) results in

[Hy,tn(u)] =0. (3.45)

Furthermore, considering the off-diagonal matrix elements of (3.44) and taking into account Eq. (3.12)
one can show that

{In (ips) +Hy, Cy (u) =0 and {In ( - ips) + Hy, By (u)]| =0. (3.46)

Thus in the homogeneous case the Hamiltonian belonging to the Cy(u) family is obtained from
the bulk Hamiltonian (3.43) by adding the boundary operator In (ins). In full analogy to the
closed spin chain it can be shown that the operators Cxy(u) and By(u) are related to each other
by the inversion transformation, J Cn (u) =-B n(u)J. Therefore, it is sufficient to consider only
one of them.

3.2.1 Inhomogeneous chains

Spin systems that are interesting in QCD context are somewhat more complicated and correspond
to inhomogeneous open spin chains with impurities [43]. In a typical setup one can assume that
the spins on all sites except for the last one are equal to each other, s, = s, 1 <k< N. The

monodromy matrix in this case takes the form
TO (u) = Li (u)Lo(u)... Ly (ut iw) Ly (u— iw)... Lo(u)Ly(u), (3.47)

where w is an impurity parameter. The dependence on w comes only through the Lax operators
Ly so that it is easy to check that TY (w) is an even function of w, ie. BW) (u) = BU” (u)
etc. Since (BY (u))t = BO’ )(u*) = BY Nut), this symmetry implies that the corresponding
conserved charges are hermitian operators if the impurity parameter w is either real or imaginary.

We will show that the operators BO (w), E(u) commute with the Hamiltonian FT) with

added boundary operators, cf. (3.46),
[In (ipSD) + 9, Ew (u)] = 0, [in (— ips) +. By(u)] =0, (3.48)

Finally, adding the contribution from the boundary operator In(—ips) one ends up with the

The similar equation with In ( - ips) + In (ius) holds for E(u),

It is instructive to compare this result with the more conventional spin chains that appear in the
analysis of the RGE for light quark-gluon operators, of the type y(z1n)f(zen)... f(zn_in)W(znn),
cf. (2.14). In such applications the spins on the first and the last sites can differ from the spins in
the bulk, which are all equal, and also the impurity parameters w; and wy, on the first and the
last site can be nonzero. The monodromy matrix for such a system takes the form

4 Heavy-light eigenfunctions

The basis formed by the eigenfunctions of the operator By plays a distinguished role in the QISM
and defines the so-called Sklyanin representation of separated variables (SoV) [10]. Since By
commutes with the Hamiltonian (3.48), the latter is diagonalized in this basis and therefore the
calculation of its spectrum becomes straightforward. These eigenfunctions for homogeneous spin
chains, for closed as well as open ones, were constructed in [35, 42]. For our applications it is
necessary to generalize this construction to inhomogeneous open spin chains with impurities.

The eigenfunctions of By operator for homogeneous closed spin chains were already introduced
in Sec. 3.1, Eq. (3.20). The eigenfunctions for the open spin chain [35, 42] take a similar form.
In both cases the eigenfunctions are labeled by N real parameters, X = {p,x1,...,¢n—i}, where
p= 0, and have the form

Wx (2) = Vpar,..cey_1}(2) = bn (p) An (a1) An—1(#2) ..-Ao(@y_ie7?* (4.1)

The function Ajy(z1,...,2Z.¢|W1,---War_-1) for a closed chain is given in Eq. (3.24) and can be
visualized as the diagram in Fig. 1. The corresponding expression for an open chain is more
complicated and is presented in diagrammatic form (for M = 4) in Fig. 2 where the vertices imply
integration with the measure (2.19). Diagrammatic representation for the eigenfunctions Wx (7)

of open and closed spin chains is shown in Fig. 3.

/n/nFigure 3. Diagrammatic representation for the eigenfunctions of the open (left) and closed (right)
homogeneous spin chains for N = 4. The indices are ag = s — ix, and By = $+ ixg.

The proof that Ux(Z) (4.1) diagonalizes the corresponding B-operator relies on the following
properties of the layer operators [35, 42]:

By(x)An(a) =0 and Au (2)Am-1(y) = Au(y)Am-1(2)- (4.4)

The layer operator for open chain has an additional symmetry A;(x) = Ay(—2x). From the second
equation in (4.4) it is obvious that Ux is a symmetric function of separated variables 71,...,¢N—1
, for the open chain). The first equation ensures that the operator By(a,) (for open

tx;,)) annihilates the function Vx. Taking into account that the operator By(u) (closed
N-1

chain) is a polynomial of degree N — 1 in wu and the coefficient of the senior power u* is simply

From this representation using Eq. (3.21) it follows whe bala). that Wx for closed chain is an
eigenfunction of the operator By(u) with an eigenvalue by(u) = —p Te 1 ‘(u — xp). Similarly,
the operator By(u) for open chain is a polynomial of degree N — 1 in u? and the representation

analogous to (4.5) holds, with obvious substitutions u > u?, aj; > a. It follows that Vx for open
chain is an eigenfunction of By(u) with an eigenvalue by(u) = —p a L(u? — x).

Since By(u) (closed chain) and By(u) (open chain) are self-adjoint operators for real u, their
eigenfunctions are orthogonal for different sets X,X’ of separated variables. One obtains [35, 42]

(Wx, Ux) = (22)! a(p—p') (sere »( s#)) Ter 7)

In the applications to operator renormalization in HQET [18, 19] one encounters an inhomo-
geneous open spin chain with impurities and the above construction of the eigenfunctions of By
operator for homogeneous spin chain has to be modified. In practice one needs a special case
where all spins except for the last one are equal, s, = s for k < N while sy # s, and the impurity
parameter €y = iw #0.

Note that the operator BY” (u) depends only on w?, as can easily be seen from Eq. (3.47), and

as a consequence Bw (u) is a self-adjoint operator for both real and imaginary w. One can show
hat the corresponding eigenfunction has the form (4.1) with modified layer operators that still
obey the relations in (4.4). The necessary changes are summarized in Fig. 4 where the modified
propagators are shown by fat lines. Note that also the integration measure for the vertices involving

hese lines is affected. Using the technique developed in [35, 42] it is easy to check that the modified

ayer operators have the required properties.

case, taking into account that the Gependence on. w comes only from the Ly(u + iw) operator, cf.
Eq. (3.47), one can argue that ue (2) and wor (2) have to be proportional to one another and,
comparing the asymptotics in the region z1 >> z2 >>... >> zy, find that indeed yz) = vo (2).

The complete description of the discrete eigenstates goes beyond the scope of this paper. As an

to go over to the momentum space. We define the momentum-space eigenfunction Wn, p2) by

The spin chains which are relevant for the heavy hadron phenomenology correspond to the
s = 1, N =2 closed spin chain [17] and s; = 3, sg=lw= 3 open spin chain [18].
5 Light-to-heavy reduction

Physics behind the construction of the HQET is that one restricts oneself to the situations where
the heavy quark interacts with light particles (quarks and gluons) with momenta that are much
smaller than the quark mass mg . In this case the heavy quark becomes almost stationary in its
rest frame, with its wave function oscillating rapidly with time V(t) ~ e~’"¢* so that the generator
of translations reduces to sg) ~ —img. Physical intuition suggests that this limit can be studied
starting from usual s/(2) algebra and rescaling the symmetry generators acting on the heavy quark

5) 38) gp tg 4 00, (5.1)

In this Section we investigate this possibility.
Consider a system consisting of one heavy quark (h) and one light quark (q). The two-particle
generators are

sm = 5 +54 8 +8 = v8 + 011),

sia) = 5 a. 5) =O(1). 5.2

The two-particle quadratic Casimir operator becomes
3, = Ss + sia" si — 1) ass + O(1) 5.3

and the two-particle Hamiltonian (3.6) simplifies to

Han = 2{W(Jan) - (| Sln (as??s®) +074). 5.4

19
/n/nSince the “heavy” and “light” generators act on different spaces we can write, omitting the
inessential constant

Hn > In (ius{?) +In ( - ips) (5.5)

where yw is an arbitrary parameter with dimension of mass. Thus the heavy and light degrees
of freedom decouple from one another which is the statement of factorization, with being the
factorization scale. In HQET only light degrees of freedom remain so that the second part of the
Hamiltonian in (5.5) is dropped and the remaining part

HEOET _ yy (ius?) (5.6)

coincides with the heavy-light Hamiltonian (2.11) (up to the scheme-dependent constant) found in
[25-27] by explicit calculation of one-loop diagrams.

Next consider the eigenfunctions. Let z, and zp, be the positions of light and heavy quarks,
respectively. For light quark systems, eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian are usually sought on
the space of polynomials that can be mapped to local composite operators, see. e.g. [44]. For the
two-particle Hamiltonian in (5.4) the eigenfunctions on this space are well known

Wre(Zqs2n) = (St) (zq — zn)”, $2 Urge = (2 + 2)(N+ YU np, (5.7)

where k is a non-negative integer. For our purposes we need eigenfunctions analytic in the lower
half of the complex plane that can be constructed as follows:

1 -is, n_wrlfig\* n (2q = Zn)”

UW") (zq, 2) =e 1°*(zq— zp) » i ( “s,) (zq — Zn)" ~ (aq min), iy (5.8)
where 7 is a parameter. For Re(7) > 0 they have a finite norm with respect to the scalar
product (2.21).

The scaling in (5.1) corresponds to z, + A~!z_, so that zp < zq and also n = O(at/2),
Extracting the leading behavior at \ + oo one breaks the conformal symmetry so that the states
(5.8) with different 7 are no longer degenerate and the system “chooses” a particular solution tha

satisfies the residual symmetry to the special conformal transformations,

/n/nreproducing the result in (2.13) [28] up to a different normalization.

It is easy to convince oneself that the same reduction procedure applies to the conserved
charges for both closed and open spin chains. For this discussion it is convenient to enumerate sites
of the chain by i = 0,1,...,.N and associate the “heavy quark” with the site i = 0, zy 4 A7!zp.

For a closed spin chain one can start from the monodromy matrix (3.2) for the system of N

light and one heavy quark,

Uf (ys Ay(u) By(u)
Ty+i(u) = fue (% “wf (ort Dy(u))? (5.12)

so that rescaling the heavy quark generators (5.1) one obtains the transfer matrix (3.5)
tyya(u) 4 MS CN(u) + O(A°) (5.13)

assuming u < A. Dismissing the prefactor rvs” that acts on the heavy degrees of freedom we are
thus left with a family of conserved charges C'y acting on the light quarks. For the simplest case

of leading-twist distribution amplitudes of heavy baryons considered in [17] one obtains

Co(u) =u +@, Q=i(sP+s?), Q=sis?) — 5P)5. (5.14)
Exactly in the same way one finds that the transfer matrix for the open spin chain thrown) (u),

see Eq. (3.63), takes the form

tron) (u) — d2i(u - 5) scl (uw) + O(\°). (5.15)

zo b A>0Oo

For the simplest case N = 2 we get

Co(u) = 2% (« + 5) (wQ, + Q2), (5.16)
where

Qi=sY+s0,
Qe = [w} — jalja — HIS? — SO (SPs + sp?sy?) — sy? (SPs — ss). (6.17)

For the twist-four heavy-light operators considered in [19] there is additional complication. In
his situation several operators exist which mix together by the RG equations. i.e. the relevant
Hamiltonians have matrix structure. This case is considered in the Appendix.

Thus we see that conserved charges and Hamiltonians of the spin chain models which describe
he scale dependence of the light quark-gluon operators in the “heavy-quark” limit zp, — zp,/A,
zp0n ~ O(A°), A > co go over to the conserved charges and Hamiltonians of the spin chains
hat arise in studies of the scale dependence of heavy-light operators. This observation alone is,
however, not sufficient to guarantee equivalence of the spectra of these models; it is only true if

he correspondence can be extended to their eigenfunctions. As shown above, this correspondence
indeed holds for the eigenfunctions of the two-particle Hamiltonian, Eq. (5.11), i.e. for N = 1.
The general case N > 1 (we remind that N refers to the number of the remaining light degrees of

21
/n/nfreedom) is more complicated. From the general concept behind effective field theories it is natural
to expect that such correspondence exists for the lowest part of the spectrum and, indeed, we
are able to verify its existence for all cases of physical relevance that have been considered so far.
Whether this conclusion can be extended beyond these examples, is not obvious.

Consider closed spin chains first. To this end we start from the “light” chain with N + 1 sites,
i=0,1,...,N. The corresponding eigenstates diagonalize the transfer matrix ty41(u) which is a
polynomial of degree N +1 in u, ty41(u) = 2uN+h + ve qu’+!-*, The eigenstates can be
labeled by eigenvalues of the conserved charges qx, or, alternatively, by roots of the transfer matrix
up, k=1,...,N +41, tw4i(up) = 0. Note that 7, uz = 0, since the subleading in u term ~ u% in
the transfer matrix is absent.

We found that in the limit (5.1) the transfer matrix for u < \ takes the form ty4i1(u) ~
ACn (uw) (5.13), where Cyy(u) is a polynomial of degree N — 1. This means that some of the roots
of the transfer matrix must become large in this limit, and the simplest way how Eq. (5.13) may
hold is when a pair of roots move to infinity with opposite sign, say, uv41 ~ —UuNn ~ VX. This
asymptotic behavior corresponds to the situation when all conserved charges are large and of the
same order, qx ~ A. Eigenstates for which the conserved charges satisfy this relation are close to
the lower boundary of the energy spectrum, see e.g. [45, 46].

Our conjecture is that for such eigenstates the correspondence between the large-spin limit
nw~ VX — oo of the “light” spin chain and the “heavy-light” chain holds, of the form

WY, (215222 20 = 2h/X) > WEN uy 9 (2s 2H): (5.18)

where Wey uy a (Zs ...,2N) is the eigenstate of the “heavy-light” spin chain.
This correspondence can be illustrated by the following example. The lowest-energy eigenfunc-
tions for the closed spin chain with three sites (spin s = 1) correspond to the solutions with q3 = 0

and are known explicitly for even n [5]

which coincides with the solution ¢s,2-9 obtained in [17]. For higher-lying states, expressions
for the eigenfunctions of three light quarks are not known in explicit form so that verifying this
correspondence is less straightforward. However, it is possible to check that the energies expressed

in terms of the roots uz indeed coincide in this limit.

22
/n/nThe corresponding construction for open spin chains is analogous. In this case we also can
abel the eigenfunctions of the original “light” model with N + 1 sites by the roots of the transfer

matrix, which come in pairs tu,, k = 1,...,.N +1. We consider the limit when one root is large,
un41 ~ VA, and all others are finite, O(A°). Similar to closed chains such a hierarchy corresponds
o the situation when all charges are large and of the same order. We notice also that one of the
roots in this limit is purely kinematical, uy = i/2. Thus the limiting eigenfunction is labeled by
he remaining N — 1 roots of the transfer matrix and depends also on the parameter 7 related to
he residual symmetry transformation. We, therefore, expect that the conjecture (5.18) may hold
or the lowest eigenstates of open spin chains as well.

As an example, consider the open spin chain with three sites that arises in the description of

she evolution of quark-antiquark-gluon operators of twist three in the large N¢ limit [4, 43, 47]. This
is a model with spins (so, $1, 82) = (1, 3, 1) and impurities (wo, wi, w2) = (3, 0, 3). Its eigenstates
satisfy the equation QyV, = qs(n)V, where

Qu = {$2,, $2} — 2wS3, — 2wo Se. (5.22)

Here {.,.} stands for the anticommutator and 5. are the two-particle quadratic Casimir operators.

This expression coincides with the discrete state solution YO(x, z2) for the heavy quark — light
antiquark — gluon RG equation found in [18].

A word of caution has to be added. Although the given examples support the conjecture in
Eq. (5.18), we do not claim that there exists a one-to-one correspondence between the eigenfunctions
of generic light models in the large spin limit and heavy-light models. A counterexample can easily
be found. Indeed, in the same open chain model considered above one can try to make the particle
with i = 2 heavy instead of i = 0, ie. consider the limit zp = z,/ > 0 instead of z — 0. It turns
out that the eigenfunction in this limit becomes non-normalizable. Thus the lowest energy discrete
state of the “light” chain disappears from the spectrum and is not present in the corresponding

“heavy-light” chain. A detailed study of this phenomenon goes beyond the tasks of this work.

°’This is a new result.

23
/n/nAnother issue is that beyond leading order the identification of the effective theory acting
on light degrees of freedom as HQET is expected to break down because of contributions of
hard-collinear gluon emission and a more general, e.g. soft-collinear effective theory, may arise.
This is one more topic for future study.

6 Summary

Evolution equations for many physically relevant heavy-light operators in QCD turn out to be
integrable in the multi-color limit. The novelty of these systems is that the corresponding conserved
charges are generated by the off-diagonal element of the monodromy matrix C(u) instead of the
race of monodromy matrix as it happens for the light quark-gluon operators. These evolution
equations can be solved with the help of QISM, resulting in a better understanding of the structure
of the B-meson distribution amplitudes of leading and subleading twists [18, 19]. The aim of this
paper is to present a more detailed mathematical treatment of such spin chain models in QISM
ormalism and explain details of the derivation omitted in [18, 19]. This is done in Sects. 3-4.
Another aim is to explore the observation made in [17, 18] that a certain similarity exists
etween the spectrum of the heavy-light spin chains and ordinary SL(2,R)-invariant spin chains in

she large spin limit [45, 46]. One finds on several examples that the expressions for the ground state

wave functions, mass gaps, etc. in both models coincide. In Sec. 5 we suggest an explicit mapping

yehind this correspondence. It turns out that that sending zp, — 0, where zp is a coordinate
associated with the “heavy quark”, the Hamiltonian and conserved charges of the “light” spin

chain models factorize and go over to the Hamiltonian and conserved charges of the “heavy-light”
models.

We further argue that such correspondence extends to the low-lying states at the eigenfunction
level in a certain scaling limit, which means that such states can be studied using effective theory
methods. In particular, eigenfunctions of the lowest energy states with large spin in the “light”
sector can be approximated by the eigenfunctions of the conserved charge C(u), which can be
constructed with the help of Sklyanin’s method of Separation of Variables (SoV). We have checked
that this conjecture indeed works in several cases where analytic expressions for the eigenstates are
known. Alternative method for the analysis of low-lying states for the “light” spin chain models
in the large spin limit is based on the the semiclassical expansion of the solution of the Baxter
equation, see e.g. [45, 46]. In this approach the wave functions of “light” models can be obtained

as a convolution of the corresponding Baxter functions with the transition kernel to the SoV
representation which is nothing but an eigenstate of the “heavy-light” spin chain, inviting for an
effective theory interpretation of this method. One can hope that using QISM technique it will be
possible to give this interpretation a more precise meaning.

1 Twist-four operators

In this section we explain the method which was used in [19] to construct the conserved charges
for the Hamiltonians describing the scale-dependence of higher-twist heavy-light operators. To
this end we consider a particular example of an operator doublet

5? _ ( v- (21). fe+(@) hv (0)
Qn = (are : (A.1)

The evolution kernel (Hamiltonian) for the operators Q), is given by a 2 x 2 matrix

Ai Hie
Hp = . A.2
n (ii in) (A2)

Explicit expressions for the kernels Hj, can be found, e.g., in [14, 48, 49]. Our aim is to find the
conserved charges Q; that commute with the Hamiltonian H;,. This can be done using standard
techniques starting from the spin chain with complete conformal SO(4,2) symmetry. The method
described below allows one to stay with the SL(2) subgroup and achieve the same result in a more
straightforward way.

To start with, consider the twist-three light quark-antiquark-gluon operator,

Qagq = V+ (21) f+ (22)h4 (20) - (A.3)

The corresponding evolution equation is well-studied. The evolution kernel in the large N, limit
commutes with the (three-particle) quadratic Casimir operator S* and with an additional conserved
charge, Qy (5.22) with impurity parameters, w) = w2 = 3. Note that Qy is written in terms of the
two-particle quadratic Casimir operators of the SL(2,R) group.

The trick is to use this result to construct the conserved charges for the twist-four operator,

w_(21) faa (22) 04 (20)
B= | ven) fr—(e2)04 (0) | - (Aa)

04 (a) fr+ (22) (20)

The operators (A.3) and (A.4) do not mix under the collinear conformal SL(2,R) transformation,
but they are related by a transformation involving the full conformal group. As a consequence, the
conserved charge Qy for the twist-four operators (A.4) can be found by promoting the SL(2, R)
two-particle Casimir operators in Eq. (5.22) to the two-particle Casimir operators of the full
conformal group SO(4, 2), $2, + S,

on = {S?,, So} _ 2w38?, — 2w 1 S3o (A.5)

and projecting the SO(4, 2) operators onto the twist-four subspace (A.4). Explicit expressions for
the generators of the full conformal group in the so-called light-ray operator representation are

25
/n/ngiven in [50]. The corresponding two-particle Casimir operators can be written as [14]°
2 _ Jix(Jiz—1) 0 3, -_( ~1/2 2rd +2
2 0 Se , 2 21201 +1 1/2 ,
“A S2 0 > —1/2 20209 + 1
gz, [P20 , Jo =— ; A6
0 ( 0 Jao (Joo — 1) z9902 +2 1/2 (A6)

where Se, 53 are the corresponding SL(2, R) Casimir operators:
2 2 3 2 ‘ 2 3
Sig = —01 02245 + O22 + 7h S59 = —09022 99 + Oo202 + 1 (A.7)

Using these expressions in (A.5) one obtains the conserved charge Qy as a 3 x 3 matrix with
operator entries.

Finally, we perform the ”light-to-heavy” reduction for this charge, zo > z,/A, \ > co. The
Casimir operator S, factorizes in this limit:

83, = 5S + 000°), (A.8)
where
2510223 0 0
S =| 0 &8 o |, (A.9)
0 0 25123

and as the result the charge Oy takes the form
Q =asO!? + 000°), (A.10)

where ow is a two-particle operator acting on the remaining light degrees of freedom,

. ok _ (9)
Q = (E12, G4} — 2w7E = (S49), (A.11)
0 Qe

Here Q\) is a 2 x 2 matrix, which commutes with the evolution kernel (A.2) for the operator
doublet (A.1) and the remaining entry Q is the conserved charge (5.17). The conserved charges
for all other twist-four heavy-light operators considered in Ref. [19] can be obtained in this manner.
