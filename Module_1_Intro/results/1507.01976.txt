1 Introduction

Equivariant stable homotopy theory has become notorious for its profusion of

fixed point func

ors. The most superficially arcane of these, the geometric fixed

points first defined in [LMS86] 811.9], also have the best formal properties. Let
G be a finite group and H a subgroup; let Sp© be the oo-category of genuine
G-spectra. Then the geometric H-fixed point spectrum, which we will regard

as a functor

6" : Sp° = Sp,

is uniquely determined by the following properties:

1. 6” commutes with all homotopy colimits, and

2. 6" is compatible with the suspension spectrum functor in that the dia-
gram of functors

commutes.
/n/nThe following additional pleasant properties follow:
3. &” has a natural enhancement to a symmetric monoidal functor.

4. (Geometric fixed point Whitehead theorem) If E is a G-spectrum such that
©" F is contractible for all subgroups H of G, then E itself is contractible.

This last property strongly suggests that it might be possible to present G-
spectra as diagrams of their geometric fixed point spectra, much as the spectral
Mackey functor approach of and employs the genuine fixed point
spectra E”, Such a presentation would obviously be desirable, since there are
many spectra - for example, those arising as norms in the sense of §B.5]
- whose geometric fixed points are much more accessible than their genuine fixed
points. Some subtlety turns out to be required in this. For example, already
for G = C, it’s easy to see that the spaces of natural transformations in both
irections between 6° and the underlying spectrum, or identity fixed point,
functor 6‘ are contractible. Nevertheless, it can be done, and in this paper,
we give a construction that accomplishes this and significantly more, drawing
together work of Abram and Kriz and Arone and Ching [AC15], which
itself generalizes previous work of Bauer and McCarthy [BM03]. We stress
that this presentation gives a completely new model of G-spectra in which the
fundamental data are geometric fixed point spectra, their homotopical actions
by groups derived from G, and gluing data relating these. To motivate this
generalization, we'll draw attention to an analogy between equivariant stable
homotopy theory and functor calculus, which was first pointed out to us by
Mike Hopkins. For G = C2 and a G-spectrum E, we have a natural cofiber
sequence, the norm cofibration sequence

Eng > EG > ®°E.

On the other hand, suppose that F’ : Sp > Sp is a reduced 2-excisive functor in
the sense of Goodwillie [Goo91]. Then the Taylor tower of F is simply a cofiber
sequence of functors

D.F > F > PF

where D2F is the 2-homogeneous part of F and P,F is the 1-excisive approxi-
mation. Fixing a spectrum X, let’s specialize further to the case where EF is the
indexed smash product X©? and F is the functor

W:Sp—Sp, W(T) = (T*™)@,

evaluated on X. Then the norm cofibration sequence and the Taylor tower
become equivalent cofiber sequences

(X°)nc, > (XAC2)C2 o> xX.
This equivalence can be made into the basis for an equivalence of co-categories

Sp ~ Fun?°** (Sp, Sp)
/n/nbetween Sp and the category of reduced 2-excisive functors Sp + Sp under
which the identity fixed points correspond to the second derivative and the
geometric C'-fixed points correspond to the first derivative.

This coincidence suggests the existence of a systematic analogy between
Goodwillie derivatives and geometric fixed points. This paper develops a com-
mon context for the Goodwillie calculus of functors between stable oo-categories
and equivariant stable homotopy theory - that of Mackey functors on epiorbital
categories - which makes this analogy precise. In brief, n-excisive functors are
governed by the category FS” of finite sets of cardinality at most n and surjec-
tive maps in precisely the same way as G-spectra are governed by the category
Og of transitive G-sets, and the visible equivalence of categories between FS?
and Og, accounts for the equivalence between Sp© and Fun? °*“(Sp, Sp).

A beautiful presentation of n-excisive functors on spectra via structure on
their derivatives has been constructed by Arone and Ching in [AC15], and we
extend their result to our more general context, where it provides the desired
presentation of the oo-category of G-spectra. Along the way, we develop a
formalism of stratified stable oo-categories that encompasses, on the one hand,
the category of Mackey functors on a epiorbital category, and on the other
hand, monoidal stable oo-categories equipped with a family of homological lo-
calizations, such as the category of p-local spectra with its chromatic filtration.
Our theorem will be a special case of a general reconstruction theorem for ob-
jects of stratified stable oo-categories. In the context of families of homologi-
cal localizations, similar results have been obtained by Antolin-Camarena and
Barthel [ACB14]. In upcoming work, we plan to use this presentation to give an
explicit and homotopy-invariant description of the Hill-Hopkins-Ravenel norm.

The structure of the paper is as follows. In Section [2] we develop the theory
of epiorbital categories and their Mackey functors, culminating in the statement
and proof of our version, Theorem[2.38] of the Arone-Ching comonadicity theo-
rem Theorem 3.13]. In Section[3] we define stratified stable oo-categories
(Definition ) and give several examples, then state and prove the classifica-
tion of objects of a stratified stable oo-category (Theorem [3.21), in effect giving
a description of the category of coalgebras for the comonad of Section] We un-
pack the implications of our theorem for Cp-spectra in detail in Examples[3.29]
obtaining the classical description of C,-spectra via the Tate fracture square.
Finally, in the short Section [4] we prove a strong and general splitting theorem
reminiscent of the tom Dieck splitting, Theorem[4.2] for Mackey functors valued
in K(n)-local spectra, recovering a result of Kuhn on functor calculus.
We believe the G-spectrum case of this theorem to be new.

This project has benefited from conversations with Greg Arone, Clark Bar-
wick, Michael Ching, Jacob Lurie, Randy McCarthy and Tomer Schlank. A
significant part of the impetus for the paper came from a question posed by
Mike Hopkins to Clark Barwick. We thank Clark Barwick for emphasizing the
importance of the nonabelian derived category and describing how to deduce
Theorem[2.32] from Lemma[2.36] We thank David Ayala, Aaron Mazel-Gee and
Nick Rozenblyum for pointing out an erroneous hypothesis in Definition [3.5]
Finally, we wish to thank all of the participants of the Bourbon Seminar for

/n/ngenerating and sustaining an environment of such productivity week after week.

2 Epiorbital categories and Mackey functors

Our Arone-Ching theorem will be applicable to a certain class of “generalized
equivariant homotopy theories” that encompasses the usual theory of genuine G-
spectra and the theory of n-excisive functors on spectra. Such a theory springs
from a “epiorbital category” with properties similar to the category of orbits
for a finite group G.

Definition 2.1. A epiorbital category or EOC is an essentially finite category
M satisfying the following condtions:

e Every morphism in M is an epimorphism.

e M admits pushouts and coequalizers; equivalently, M admits colimits
over finite connected diagrams.

Epiorbital categories have a strong directionality.

Definition 2.2. It follows immediately from Yoneda’s lemma that any endo-
morphism in a epiorbital category is an isomorphism, and so the set of isomor-
phism classes of objects of M carries a natural partial order wherein [X] > [Y]
if and only if the morphism set M(X,Y) is nonempty. We'll call this poset Py.

Example 2.3. Let G be a finite group. Then the orbit category Og, which is

defined as the category of sets with transitive G-action, is a EOC.

Example 2.4. If G is a finite group and H a subgroup, then the full subcategory
Oaju © OG

spanned by those orbits on which H acts trivially is again a EOC. There’s no
clash of notation here, for if H happens to be normal, then Og,y is clearly just
the orbit category of the group G/H.

Example 2.5. Let F, be the category of finite sets and surjective maps and let
FS" be the full subcategory of F, spanned by the sets of cardinality at most n.
Then FS" is a EOC.

The following properties of epiorbital categories will be useful:

Lemma 2.6. Let M be a EOC, let K be any finite category and let p: K > M
be a functor. Then the overcategory M7, is a EOC.

Proof. Immediate. Oo

Lemma 2.7. Let M be a EOC. Then any connected component of M has a
final object.
/n/nProof. We'll show that any object of M whose isomorphism class is minimal
with respect to the natural partial order is final in its connected component.
Indeed, let T be such an object and let X an object in its connected component.
Then there’s a zigzag of morphisms

Thy Sy &...& x.

By taking iterated pushouts, we can inductively replace this zigzag with a dia-
gram

TSYEX.
Moreover, by the choice of T, f must be an isomorphism, so there is a morphism
from X to T. Now suppose we have a pair of morphisms

fig: X aT.

Then h, the coequalizer of f and g, is a morphism with source T, and therefore
an isomorphism. By composing with h~!, we see that f = g. oO

If C is any category, we'll denote by C" the closure of C under formal finite
coproducts. By definition, C™ is the full subcategory of Fun(C°?, Set) spanned
by the finite coproducts of representable functors. This is an operation we’ll
frequently want to perform on EOCs.

Example 2.8. O} is equivalent to F@, the category of all finite G-sets, since
any finite G-set decomposes uniquely into orbits.

One very relevant property of F° is that it’s meaningful to take Mackey
functors over it: F© is disjunctive in the sense of [Barl4], so its effective Burn-
side oo-category A°/!(F) can be formed and admits direct sums. We’ll quickly
recall these ideas.

Definition 2.9. Let C be an oo-category which admits finite products and
coproducts and a zero object. We’ll say that C admits direct sums, or is semi-
additive, if for every pair of objects X,Y € C, the natural map

XUY>XxKY

provided by the zero object is an equivalence.

Remark 2.10. It’s not hard to see that each mapping space of a semiadditive
oo-category naturally carries the structure of a commutative monoid space; the
term additive co-category is traditionally reserved for categories whose mapping
spaces are grouplike.

Definition 2.11. An oo-category C is called disjunctive if

e C admits pullbacks and finite coproducts,
/n/ne for each finite set J and for each J-tuple (X;)icr of objects of C, the

natural functor
TI ox. > Cru. x.
i

is an equivalence of categories.

Let C be an oo-category which admits pullbacks. Then one can construct
3.6] an oo-category A*ff(C), called the effective Burnside category of
C, whose objects are those of C, whose morphisms are spans

YL”,

in C, and where composition is performed by forming pullbacks.

Proposition 2.12. 4.3] If C is disjunctive, then A°/S(C) is semiaddi-
tive.

oO

Example 2.13. A functor from A°/!(F°) to Ab which preserves direct sums
is precisely a Mackey functor in the sense of [tD73].

The content of the next lemma is that it’s meaningful to talk about Mackey
functors over arbitrary epiorbital categories:

Lemma 2.14. Let M be a epiorbital category. Then M" is disjunctive.

Proof. The condition that

[lox > Sux:

is an equivalence is satisfied for any C of the form D™, so we only need to show
that M"™ admits pullbacks.
Let p: A3 = M" be a diagram

Ni— &

Y —>

in M"™. If any of X, Y or Z are empty then the pullback exists and is empty,
so let’s assume all are nonempty.

If Z decomposes nontrivially as a coproduct Z1 [| Z2, we get a decomposition
of diagrams p = p1 J] p2, and if each p; admits a limit W;, then W, [| W2 is a
limit of p. Thus it suffices to assume Z is representable.
/n/nOn the other hand, if X decomposes nontrivially as X; [| Xo, and if

Ww, — XxX Wz ——> Xo
i ee
Y — > Z, Y —>Z

are pullback diagrams, then

Wil[W2 —> x

| |

Y ——> Z

is a pullback diagram. After carrying out the same argument for Y, it’s enough
to assume that X, Y and Z are all representable - in other words, that p may
be lifted to a diagram p: A3 > M.

But it now follows from Lemma [2.6] and Lemma [2.7] that p admits a limit,
since to give a limit of p in M4 is, tautologically, to give a final object in each
connected component of the EOC Mz. im]

Definition 2.15. There is a more general notion of orbital co-category which
features centrally in the upcoming work (BDG* 16]. An orbital oo-category
is simply any oo-category M for which M"™ admits pullbacks, from which it
follows that M4" is disjunctive. By Lemma[2.14] epiorbital categories are orbital.
Epiorbital categories are the focus of this paper, but some results will be stated
for general orbital co-categories.

Definition 2.16. If M is an orbital oo-category, we'll write A°//(M) for the
effective Burnside category A°//(M"); we don’t expect this notation to cause
confusion. A°/!(M) is semiadditive, and if C is a semiadditive presentable oo-
category, then we’ll denote by Mack(M, C) the category of C-valued Mackey
functors on M: the category of additive (ie. direct-sum-preserving) functors
from M to C. If C = Sp, then we’ll usually omit C and refer to the category
simply as Mack(M).

Example 2.17. When M is the orbit category Og, Mack(M) is the category
of spectral Mackey functors for G [Barl4], which is a model for the homotopy
theory of genuine G-spectra.

Example 2.18. The natural target of both the genuine fixed point functor (—)”
and the geometric fixed point functor @” (of which more anon) on Mack(Oq)
is Mack(Og/1) (Example [2.4), even when H is not normal in G.

Theorem 2.19. When M is the category FS" of Example [2.5] Mack(M, C)
is equivalent to the category of (reduced, filtered-colimit-preserving) n-excisive
functors from Sp to C. This equivalence has the property that if F: Sp > C
is n-excisive, if E is the corresponding Mackey functor and if S is a set, then
/n/nE(S) is equivalent to the S-indexed cross-effect of F evaluated on an S-indexed
set of spheres. In particular, if S has n-elements, then E(S') is equivalent to the
nth derivative D,,F as spectra with },,-action.

This equivalence is the subject of the separate paper :

The following is a significant technical lemma that provides control over the
values of many universally defined Mackey functors, including the fixed points
of the free genuine equivariant G-spectrum on a spectrum with G-action.

Lemma 2.20. Suppose that A, B, C are semiadditive co-categories and ¢ :
A > B, F: A > C are additive functors. Suppose the left Kan extension
oF :B- C exists. Then @)F is additive.

Proof. We must verify that ¢:F preserves zero objects and direct sums of pairs
of objects. The first is obvious, so let X,Y be objects of B. Then

OF(X @Y) x colim F(Z).
(6(Z)>X®Y )EAXBB;xey

Let
a:(A xp Bx) x (A xB By) > A XB Byxoy

be the functor with

a(¢(Z1) > X, 6(Z2) + Y) = (¢(Z1 @ Zz) ~ O(Z1) © b(Z2) 2 X BY).

Then we claim that a is cofinal. Thus we must verify that for each object
k:0(Z) + X ®Y of A xp B;xoy, the overcategory

O:= (A Xp B/x) x (A XB Byy) XaxpByxay (A XB B/xe@y)/k
is weakly contractible. Indeed, we claim that O has an initial object. An object
of O is a pair (Z1, Z2) of objects of A together with a morphism 6: Z > Z;@Z

and a commutative diagram

o(Z) —*-+ x@Y

|o

o(Z, ® Za).

Then the initial object of O is evidently the diagonal map A: Z > Z@Z
together with the commutative diagram

)_*.xey

“a

o(Z ® Z).
/n/nNow there is a commutative diagram

(A xp Byx) x (A xp By) “882 c
|: '
A xp Bxoy,
allowing us, by our cofinality result, to rewrite
OF(X ®Y)~ colim F(Z) ® F(Z2).

(0(21) 4 X,6(Z2) 3Y)€(AxBB;x)x(AxBByy)
Now for any pair of functors b1,b2 : K — C, we have the commutation of
colimits

colim (b; @ bz) ~ colim (b;) @ colim (b2).

In particular, if b is the constant functor valued at some object P, then

colim (b; ® bz) ~ colim (bi) @(P @ K),
and if K is weakly contractible, then
colim (b; @ bz) & colim (b)) @ P.

Note that A xp B,;x is weakly contractible for every X € B: indeed, the
essentially unique object

(04, ¢(04) ~ Op > X)
is an initial object of A xp B;x. Hence

F(X @Y)~ F(Z,) ® F(Z2)

colim
(¢(Z1) 3X, ¢(Z2)4Y)€(AX BB; x)x(AxBB;y)

x colim colim F(Z,) ® F(Z2)
(¢(Z1)>X)EAXBB;x (¢(Z2) 9Y)EAxBBy

x colim F(Z1) ® @F(Y)
(¢(Z41)3X)EAxBB;x

~ F(X) © OF (Y).
o

If I and J are disjunctive oo-categories and F : I + J is a functor which
preserves pullbacks and finite coproducts, then F' clearly induces an additive
functor

ASSP): AFD) > ALS),

So if C admits limits and colimits, we get functors

ASIF), AF (F), : Mack(I,C) — Mack(J,C).
/n/nIf M is an orbital oo-category, we'll call a full subcategory N of M downwardly-
closed if whenever X € N and Y € M with Map(X, Y) nonempty, we also have
Y EN. Equivalently, V = ¢~1({1}) for some functor ¢: M > At. Upwardly-
closed subcategories are defined dually.

There are plenty of examples of these: if M is epiorbital, then for any
X € M, the full subcategory of M<x C M spanned by those objects Y
with [Y] < [X] is downwardly-closed. Note also that any downwardly-closed
subcategory of an orbital oo-category is itself orbital, and any downwardly-
closed subcategory of an EOC is itself a EOC.

For the following few lemmas, we'll let M be orbital, let NV be a downwardly-
closed subcategory of M and let T be its upwardly-closed complement.

Lemma 2.21. The inclusion iy : Mi 3 My admits a canonical retraction jy
which is right adjoint to iy.

Proof. By definition, My is the full subcategory of Fun(M°?, Top) spanned by
coproducts of representables, and iy; is given by left Kan extension. But since
the value of the functor represented by an object of T on any object of NV is
empty, the restriction Fun(M°P, Set) to Fun(N°?, Set) preserves coproducts of
representables. This is the desired retraction. (Note that orbitality of M is not
required for this lemma to hold.) oO

We should think of jv as “formally set all objects of T to 0”. We note that
JN preserves coproducts.

Definition 2.22. We define the geometric value at N functor
®* : Mack(M,C) + Mack(N,C)

by the left Kan extension (A°!S (jy;))1.

The right adjoint of VY, the extension by zero from N functor, will be
denoted =. For an object X of M, we'll denote 6“<* by &*. If E is an
object of Mack(M,C), then we'll write E?* for the value of 6* E on X, the
“geometric fixed point spectrum at X”.

Example 2.23. Let G be a finite group and let H < G be a subgroup. If M =
Og, then ®¢/# is the classical functor of geometric fixed points Example
B.6]. Here the usual notation would be ®”, not 6¢/" | and we apologize for
the clash.

We have an equivalence

(Oa)<ajn = Oa/n

and so ®¢/' naturally takes values in Mack(Qq/1), as previously claimed.

Example 2.24. If M = FS", and k < n, then =FS" is the functor which
regards a k-excisive functor as an n-excisive functor, and its left adjoint 67: =
is the k-excisive approximation functor.

10
/n/nDefinition 2.25. Using the notation of Lemma[2.2]] let A°/!(T) be the effec-
tive Burnside category of (T)", or equivalently, the full subcategory of Aff (M)
spanned by the objects of (T)"4. Let A°/f (iz) be the inclusion of this full sub-
category.

Remark 2.26. Let G be a groupoid. We can form the effective Burnside cate-
gory A°ff(G), since any commutative square in a groupoid is a pullback square.
Moreover, there’s a natural equivalence of oo-categories

cg : AFF(G) SG

which maps the span
& h
areyoez

to the morphism hg~!

lence.

: a — z. We'll sometimes implicitly invoke this equiva-

If X is an object of M, let Gx be the groupoid spanned by the isomor-
phism class of X. Form the effective Burnside category A°//(G¥) and let
ix : AtI(Gx) + Af(Mex) be the inclusion. It follows from the direc-
tionality of M<x that ix is fully faithful.

Since there’s no room for meaningful transfer maps, we might guess that a
Mackey functor on a group G contains no more information than an object with
G-action. This is indeed the case, but the proof is technical and so we defer the
bulk of it to Appendix [A]

Theorem 2.27. Let G be a groupoid. Then Actighy is the free semiadditive
oo-category on G: for any semiadditive co-category C, the natural inclusion
induces an equivalence of categories

Fun®(A°/(G"), C) > Fun(G, C).

We'll use this equivalence implicitly from now on.

The class of Mackey functors left or right Kan extended from groupoids
is an interesting one. For instance, let G be a finite group and let X be a
spectrum with G-action, which by Theorem we may regard as an object
of Mack(Gc/e). Denote by i: Gye < Fg the inclusion. Then the left Kan
extension of X along A‘// (i) is the free genuine G-spectrum on X,, often denoted
by

EG: AX.

Similarly, the right Kan extension is the cofree genuine G-spectrum on X, also
known as

F(EG4,X).
We know from other models of G-spectra that for any subgroup H < G,

(BG, AX)" ~ Xiu, F(EG,,X)¥ ~ Xn,

It would be desirable, however, to have a proof of these facts internal to our
framework. The following lemma is a more general version of this result:

11
/n/nLemma 2.28. Suppose M is an orbital oo-category and i: T @ M is the in-
clusion of an upwardly closed subcategory. Let C be a semiadditive oo-category
with all colimits, and let B € Mack(7,C) be a Mackey functor. Then for any
Yem,
iuB(Y)~ colim  B.
Mi x yuTt

Proof. For now, we content ourselves with a sketched proof and leave the details
as an exercise. This result will be assumed in some examples in Section B] but
will not feature integrally in the results of the paper.

For the sake of avoiding the ambiguity that can precipitate from the use of
overcategory notation, we clarify our notation. Write

Thy = My x mu qT

and

(AVF (T) jy = (ATF(M))y x zesty AY (T).

Then we have

uB(Y)~ colim B.
(AFT) /y

The objects of (ALL(T)) yy are of the form
T’
ZN
T Y.
We can define a functor V : Thy = (AST(T))y by

T
VT AY)= J.
T Y

The essential image of V comprises those diagrams for which f : T’ > T is an
equivalence, and it can be shown that V is homotopic to the inclusion of the full
subcategory (A°/S(M))/y spanned by such diagrams. Moreover, the inclusion
of (AefF(M))/y has a left adjoint ¢ with

T! T!
o) ~
T Y T’ Y
Thus this inclusion is cofinal, which yields the result. Oo

12
/n/nCorollary 2.29. Suppose M is an epiorbital category and X € M is a maximal
object. Let
ix : AST (Gx) a ASS(M)

be the inclusion, let C be a semiadditive oo-category with all colimits, and let
B € Mack(Gx,C) be a Mackey functor, which by Theorem [2:27] is uniquely
determined by B(X) regarded as an object of C with Aut(X)-action. Then for
any Y eM,

(ix) BY) ~ (B(X) x Homa (X,Y ))naut(x)-
In particular, if Y is a final object,
(ix) B(Y) ~ B(X)naut(x):
Oo

Definition 2.30. Let M be an EOC and X € M an object. The Taylor
coefficient at X functor is the functor DX : Mack(M,C) > Fun(Gx,C) given
by i, 0 ®*,

Definition 2.31. Let M~ be the maximal subgroupoid of M and define the
Taylor sequence functor

D : Mack(M,C) > Fun(M~,C)

by

\ DX.

[Xx]

We'll now enforce the hypothesis that C is stable for the remainder of the
section. This allows us to state the following important proposition, which
is a generalization of the “norm cofibration sequence” from equivariant stable
homotopy theory:

Theorem 2.32. Let NV’ be a downwardly closed subcategory of an orbital oo-
category M and T its upwardly closed complement. Denote the restriction
Acff(it)* and the left Kan extension A‘! (iy), respectively by II7 and I7.
There’s a cofiber sequence of functors Mack(M,C) + Mack(M, C)

In’ Sia 4 evo,

where € and 7) are the counit and unit of their respective adjunctions.

Theorem [2.32] has the following important equivalent form, whose theme is
that a Mackey functor contains no secret data not detected by its values:

Corollary 2.33. = is fully faithful, and its essential image is the category
Macky (M,C) of Mackey functors on M supported on NV.

13
/n/nProof. If M € Macky(M,C), then evidently II7 M is zero, and so the cofiber
sequence of Theorem [22.32] collapses to an equivalence

M ~ENONM,

which establishes the essential image of =.
Since 2% is visibly conservative, it follows for N € Mack(N,C), setting
M ==NN, that
Nx @VeNN,
and the full faithfulness of 2 follows by adjunction. Oo

Remark 2.34. Observe that Corollary
it follows abstractly that the functor

lso implies Theorem

M +> cof(ew)

is the localization into Macky(M,C). On the other hand, assuming that av
is fully faithful, 2V is the localization into its essential image. By Corollary
[2.33] these two localizations coincide, yielding [2.32]

Definition 2.35. Let DA(M) denote the nonabelian derived category of A°Sf(M):
the category of product-preserving functors A°/!(M) > Top Definition
5.5.8.8]. Equivalently, DA(M) is the category of Mackey functors on M valued
in the category CMon of commutative monoid spaces (see, for instance,
Remark 2.7]).
Let C and D be presentable oo-categories. Recall that the category of
coproduct-preserving functors from C to D is denoted Fin"(C, D), and that
the category of functors from C to D that preserve all colimits is denoted
Fun’(C,D). Now for presentable C, by Proposition 5.5.8.15], there’s
an equivalence of categories

Fun’ (DA(M), C) ~ Fun (A°(M), C).
If C is, in addition, semiadditive, this can be written as an equivalence
Fun’ (DA(M), C) ~ Mack(M, C). (x)

Lemma 2.36. Theorem holds when C = CMon.

Before proving Lemma let’s deduce Theorem from Lemma
We know

®Y : DA(M) + DAW)
is a localization. Under the equivalence of (*), =“ corresponds to
(O%)* : Fin’ (DA(N), C) > Fun’ (DA(M),C),
and by the universal property of a localization, (®)* is fully faithful, and

objects of its essential image are functors which map ® equivalences to equiv-
alences.

14
/n/nNow here’s where we use the stability of C: since a morphism in a stable
oo-category is an equivalence if and only if its fiber is zero, the objects of the
essential image of (®“)* are equivalently those functors which map objects in
the essential image of

7 : DA(T) > DA(M)
to 0 € C. But since the equivalence (*) is given by the Yoneda embedding, and
since the diagram

ATE(T) + DA(T)

Avi tn) [rr

Actl(M) + DA(M)

commutes, these correspond under (*) to the objects of Macky (M,C). This
proves Corollary 2.33] and therefore Theorem 22.32}

Proof of Lemma[2.36, The proof of this lynchpin lemma is very technical, and
so we’ve relegated it to Appendix It’s not required reading for those who
don’t care to learn to make a very specific kind of sausage, but we note that
it’s our main point of contact with the combinatorics of the effective Burnside
category. Oo

Let M be a EOC. For each X € M, we may define functors

and
LX = 8% o (ix),

where (ix)! and (ix). are left and right Kan extension respectively. Observe
that (ix): and (ix), are fully faithful, since they’re Kan extensions along a fully
faithful functor. Since we've already seen that =* is fully faithful, we conclude
that both L* and R* are fully faithful. Moreover, R* is right adjoint to the
Taylor coefficient functor D*.
Similarly, we can define
R=\/ R*

[Xx]

L=\/1*

[Xx]

and

and R is right adjoint to the Taylor sequence functor D.

Proposition 2.37. L is a section of D; that is, Do L is homotopic to the
identity.
/n/nProof. We'll use induction on the number of isomorphism classes of objects in
M. If M is a groupoid, both L and D are already the identity. In general, let
X be a maximal object of M. It’s clear that Do L is homotopic to the identity
when restricted to Gx.
Then the morphism
(ix)i(ix)*L > L

is equivalent to the summand inclusion
LX 4\/ LY
[Y]
and therefore by Theorem [2.32] we have a cofiber sequence
LX 5 Lb OM«xE

which shows that the left square in the diagram

Fun(M~, C) —4—> Mack(M,C) —2-> Fun(M~,C)

| Jens |

Fun(Mzy,C) ++ Mack(Mzx,C) 24 Fun(Mzy,C)

commutes. The right square commutes by construction, and the bottom com-
posite is homotopic to the identity by the induction hypothesis. By circumnay-
igating the diagram, we conclude that Do L is homotopic to the identity when
restricted to Gy for any Y A X. Oo

The following is our Arone-Ching theorem in its general form.

Theorem 2.38. Let M be an epiorbital category. Then the adjunction (D, R)
is comonadic.

Proof. (D, R) is comonadic if and only if the natural transformation
t : Id + Tot(Cobar(R, DR, D))

is an equvalence. We’ll closely follow Arone and Ching’s proof in [AC15]. This
involves showing, for each downwardly-closed subcategory NV of M, that the
natural map

wt NON — Tot(=’ GO Cobar(R, DR, D))
is an equivalence, by induction on the number of isomorphism classes of objects
in N. Since 2@6™ is the identity functor, this will give the result.

So assume that t? is an equivalence for all P with at most k isomorphism
classes of objects, and suppose V has k + 1 isomorphism classes of objects. Let
X be a maximal object of NV and let N’ =.N\ Gx be the result of removing the
isomorphism class of X. The cofiber sequence of Theorem gives a cofiber
sequence of functors

L* DX 4 ENON 5 ENON",

16
/n/nwhich in turn gives a map of cofiber sequences

LX DX —“_, Tot(L¥ DX Cobar(R, DR, D))

|

avov —", Tot(EV@" Cobar(R, DR, D))

i

ENON’  . Tot (2 6 Cobar(R, DR, D)).

By the induction hypothesis, i” is an equivalence, so it’ll suffice to show that
t* is an equivalence. This also starts the induction, since tY = t* if N = Gx
is a connected groupoid. But now we observe that

D* = evxD
and so
Tot(L* D* Cobar(R, DR, D)) ~ Tot(L* evx DCobar(R, DR, D))
~ Tot(L* evy Cobar(DR, DR, D))
~ L*evxD
~ LX D*
by the usual extra codegeneracy argument. This completes the proof. Oo

The next section aims to characterize the comonad DR.

3 Categories stratified along a poset

The categories Mack(M) for M a EOC, along with many other categories oc-
curing in nature, share a significant structural property: any object of Mack(M)
can be torn open by a series of fracture squares. More precisely, suppose that VV
is a downwardly-closed subcategory, T is its upwardly-closed complement and
X € Mack(M). Then we'll see that there’s a pullback square

ON X —> ON (iz), (it )*X
To build a theory of how X might be recovered from such data, itll be helpful to

widen our scope. First it’s important to advertise a potential point of significant
notational confusion.

17
/n/nWarning 3.1. When we regard a poset as a category in this paper, we will use
the opposite of the usual convention that there is a morphism from x to y if
a <y. For us, the space of morphisms from x to y will be contractible if x > y
and empty otherwise. We adopt this strange convention in order to preserve
intuitions about size of objects in our chief motivating examples of posets: the
posets of isomorphism classes of objects of the EOCs Og and FS".

Definition 3.2. Let P be a poset. An interval in P is a subset I C P such
that whenever x,y € I and x < z < y, we have z € J. If P is any poset, then
we denote by Zp be the poset of intervals in P ordered by inclusion. If J and
J are a pair of intervals, we'll write J < J if 19 J = 0 and there is no pair
(@€1,j € J) with i> j.

Note that the relation < is not a partial order: for example, if p,q € P are
incomparable, then both {p} ~ {q} and {q} ~ {p}.

Definition 3.3. Suppose C is a stable co-category. Let Ec be the poset of
stable reflective subcategories of C, ordered by inclusion; equivalently, Ec is the
opposite of the poset of exact localizations of C. Let P be a poset. Then a
pre-stratification of C along P is a map of posets

6: Ip Ec.

Before we give the criteria that will qualify a pre-stratification as a stratifi-
cation, it’ll be useful to record an elementary fact about localizations.

Lemma 3.4. Given two localizations £; and £2 on a stable co-category C such
that £1L2 = 0, the following conditions are equivalent:

(1) The natural diagram

id ——> L,

to

Ly —> Loki
is a pullback square.
(2) The containment £L2C C ker(L;) is an equality.
(3) £1 and L are jointly conservative.
Proof. The implication (1) = (3) is obvious. We’ll prove (3) > (2) => (1).
Suppose that £1 and £2 are jointly conservative; then if some

X €ker(L)) \ LoC,

the localization map X + £2X is a non-equivalence which becomes an equiv-
alence after applying either £; or Lo, establishing (2). If we now denote by C
the fiber of id > £), then

im C C LC

18
/n/n(in fact, C is the coreflection into £L2C). Now taking horizontal fibers in the
square diagram gives the morphism

C > LoC
which is an equivalence, establishing (1). Oo
Definition 3.5. In the notation of Definition B.3} let
Lr:C+C

be the localization functor corresponding to G(I). Then we call G a stratification
of C along P if the following conditions hold:

(2) if Ip < I, then £L;,L7, = 0,

(3) and if I = L,[] Io, then L;, and L;,, viewed as localization functors on
G(1), satisfy the equivalent conditions of Lemma [3.4]

Remark 3.6. Since @ < 0, axiom (2) implies that S(0) = {0}.

Remark 3.7. It follows from the latter two axioms that if J = [ [[ 2 and
Iz =< I,, then G(J) is a recollement of G(Iz) and G(J;) in the sense of
Definition A.8.1].

Remark 3.8. For most of this section we’ll assume that P is finite, but our main
result generalizes easily to certain infinite posets (Definition[3.30). n will usually
denote the cardinality of P. We’ll also assume that P is connected; it’s easy to
see that a category stratified along a disconnected poset decomposes naturally
as a direct sum of categories stratified along the connected components.

Next we’ll see some examples of stratifications. Suppose C is a presentable
symmetric monoidal stable oo-category whose tensor product preserves colimits
in each variable, so that we can talk about the homological localization with
respect to an object E € C [Bou79]:

Recollection 3.9. An object F € C is called E-acyclic if E ® F is zero. An
object G € C is called E-local if Map(F,G) is contractible for any E-acyclic
F. The E-local objects of C form a reflective subcategory Lz, with associated
localization functor Le.

Let P be a poset and suppose we have an object K, for each p € P such that
any K-local object is Ky-acyclic unless p > q. We can define a pre-stratification
Gx, of C along P by var to I the category of objects which are local with

respect to the object Vj<; K,

Proposition 3.10. Gx, is a stratification of 6«,(P) = Ly _, x,
P
Proof. The proof will consist of two lemmas, and will use induction on the

cardinality of P.

19
/n/nLemma 3.11. Suppose FE and F are such that any E-local object is F-acyclic.
Then the square of functors

is a pullback square.

Proof. This fact is folklore, and cases of it go back to Bousfield and further.
The proof, which we now give, is simple.

g and h are both E-localizations, and therefore E-equivalences, and so the
total fiber of the square is E-acyclic. On the other hand, f is an F-equivalence,
and so is 7 because its source and target are both F-acyclic. Thus the total fiber
of the square is F-acyclic, and so E V F-acyclic. But everything in the square
is EV F-local, so the total fiber must also be EV F-local, and hence zero. O

Lemma 3.12. Suppose Z C P is a proper interval and p € P is such that
I = {p}. Then any object E € Gx, (Z) is K,-acyclic.

Proof. The proof will use Theorem (spoilers). By the induction hypothesis,
Gx, restricts to a stratification of 6 x, (Z) along Z. Then the proof of Theorem
[3.21] expresses EF as a finite limit of objects which are K;-local for some i € T,
and thus K,-acyclic. Therefore E is K,-acyclic. Oo

Oo

Remark 3.13. For this class of stratifications, in the case where P is totally
ordered, a theorem similar to Theorem[3.2]has appeared previously in [ACB14].

We'll now give a pair of quick applications of Proposition [3.10]

Example 3.14. Fix a prime p. Then the Morava K-theory spectra K(0),--- , K(n)
give rise to a stratification of the category of \/j_9 K(i)-local spectra along
(D”)°?. (Recall that a spectrum is \/j!_9 K (i)-local if and only if it’s local with
respect to the Morava E-theory E,,.) The pullback squares in this stratification
include the famous chromatic fracture squares

Lr, —_—> Lr,

| |

Ly,» —> Le, Lk,

m1

which are the subject of Hopkins’ chromatic splitting conjecture [Hov93].

20
/n/nExample 3.15. Let X be a scheme; let (Ui)o<i<n be locally closed subschemes
of X such Up = X, Uj is an open subscheme of X, and for 7 > 2, U; is an open
subscheme of U;_, \ Uj_2. We say that the U; form a stratification of X.

Let QC(X) be the stable co-category of quasicoherent complexes on X.
Then the structure sheaves Oy, € QC(X), 1 <i <n, satisfy the hypotheses of
Proposition and so form a stratification of La» | Ou, QC(X) along A"-}.
In the case where hn

Uu=x,
i=1

this is a stratification of QC(X) itself.

Our other main source of examples of stratifications comes from the the-
ory developed in Section We'll be able to say something about orbital oo-
categories and substantially more about epiorbital categories.

Let M be an orbital oo-category, let NV be a downwardly-closed subcate-
gory of M, and let T be its upwardly-closed complement. If C is a stable
oo-category with all limits and colimits, let Mack(M;C) be the category of C-
valued Mackey functors on M (Definition . We define a pre-stratification
6m of Mack(M,C) along A! as follows:

¢ 6(A!) = Mack(M,C),

© Gu({1}) is the category Mack’ (M,C) of Mackey functors in the essen-
tial image of the right Kan extension from Mack(T, C),

e Gxu({0}) is the category Macky(M,C) of Mackey functors supported
on N (see Corollary 2:33).

Proposition 3.16. Gy, is a stratification.

Proof. We must show that the square

iduack(m,c) ——> £1

| |

Ly ——— > Loli

is a pullback square of endofunctors. But by taking vertical fibers and applying
Theorem [2.32] we’re reduced to showing that the natural map

P70 SPT Ly
is an equivalence, which is obvious. im]

Now suppose M is epiorbital, and let Py, be the poset of isomorphism
classes in M (Definition 2.2).

21
/n/nDefinition 3.17. We define a pre-stratification Gj, on Mack(M;C) as fol-
lows. If I C Py is any interval, let Z be the corresponding full subcategory of
M. If I is downwardly-closed, then we define

6m (1) = Mackz(M; C) (Corollary 2.33)
If J C Py is upwardly closed, then let Mack? (M,C) be the essential image
of the right Kan extension
AT (iz), : Mack(J,C) > Mack(M,C).
We define
6m(J) = Mack? (M,C).
If J C Pw is any interval, then we can write

T=L.01

where J, is the smallest upwardly-closed set containing J and J_ is, likewise,
the smallest downwardly-closed set containing J. Then we define

6mi(I) = Mack** (M,C) Mackz_ (M,C).
Proposition 3.18. Gy, is a stratification of Mack(M,C) along Py.

Proof. Clearly
6m (Pm) = Mack(M,C).

We must verify (3) in Definition[3.5] Let Z,Z),Z2, be the full subcategories of M
corresponding respectively to I, 1), J2, and let D be the smallest downwardly-
closed subcategory of M containing Z. Then by passing to Mackp(M,C) if
necessarily, we may assume that J; is upwardly-closed.

Assume for a moment that J = Pyy. Then, as in the proof of Proposition
[3.16] we conclude by taking fibers vertically and invoking Theorem In
general, we note that

In =IN (Pm \ hh).

We know that the natural diagram

id —————_» Li,

|

Leu\n —> Lpu\n£n

is a pullback square, and applying £, to the entire square gives the result. O

We'll now start setting up for our main result on the reconstruction of objects
in a stratified category from their atomic localizations.

Definition 3.19. Let P be a finite poset. Define P(P) to be the poset of
nonempty subsets T’ = {i1,i2,+-- ,i,} of P, ordered by reverse inclusion.

22
/n/nDefinition 3.20. Let (C,G) be a stable oo-category stratified along P. We
define an oo-category C® as the full subcategory of Fun(P(P),C) spanned by
those functors

F:P(P) 3C
such that
e for each T € P(P) and for each minimal element t € T, F(T) is in G({t});

e if e is an edge of P(P) of the form T + TU {p} where {p} < T, then F(e)
exhibits F(T U {p}) as the G({p})-localization of F(T).

The following, describing how objects of a stratified category can be assem-
bled using higher fracture squares, is the main theorem of this section.

Theorem 3.21. There’s an equivalence of categories
a:C>C%.

This equivalence will be constructed as an explicit zigzag in the course of the
proof.

The first step is to realize that we don’t have enough posets, and define some
more posets.

Definition 3.22. Let P’(P) be the set whose elements are nonempty sets
{I,,-++ ,J,} of nonempty, disjoint intervals in P such that for each pair of
indices i,j, either I; < I; or Ij; < I;. We'll put a partial order on P’(P) by
letting

{Li Tk} > {Tuy Tat

if there exist distinct indices (i1,--- ,i,) such that Ji, C Jj for each j.

If T € P'(P) and I € T, then we'll call I <-minimal if for each J € T with
J #1, I < J. This doesn’t necessarily imply that there is no J € T such
that J < I. However, since ~ is transitive, each T € P/(P) has at least one
~<-minimal element.

Here’s a way of “coordinatizing” a poset.

Definition 3.23. A threading of a finite poset P is a filtration
0= Peo © Per C++: Pen =P
such that for each i, P<; is downwardly closed, and
|P<i| =i.

We'll fix, once and for all, a threading on P.

23
/n/nDefinition 3.24. Let P™(P) be the subset of P’(P) containing those sets
T={h,--- In}
such that for each Jj, either |J;| = 1 or
I, = P<; for some i < m.

In particular, at most one of the J; may have cardinality > 1, and if this occurs
then J; must be a <-minimal element of T.

There’s an obvious isomorphism P!(P) & P(P).

Definition 3.25. Let CS

© be the full subcategory of Fun(P’"(P)) spanned by
those functors

F:P"™(P)3C
such that

e for each T = {I,,-+- ,J,} € P'™(P) and for each J; that is <-minimal in
T, F(L) € G(Li);

e ife:T, + Ty is an edge of P”(P) of the form
{hl Le} > (hb, Je}

with J, <-minimal in T; and J, C Iz, then F(e) exhibits F(T>) as the
6(J;,.)-localization of F(T;);

e ife: T; > Ty is an edge of P™(P) of the form
{li Io,-++ Ik} > {hi La,- ++ Te Thi}

with I,41 <-minimal, then F(e) exhibits F(T2) as the 6 (I,+41)-localization
of F(T}).

Proposition 3.26. If P has cardinality at most m, then the functor

S
m 2

ep:C
given by evaluation at {P} is an equivalence of categories.

Proof. We'll prove this by induction on m. If m = 1, there’s nothing to do.
If m = 2, then P & A! and we'll label its elements 0 and 1, with 0 > 1 (this
is unfortunately necessitated by our conventions). Then C& is the category of
squares of the form

E »>—+ Eo

[J

E, —> Eo

24
/n/nin which Ey € G(0), £1, E19 € G(1) and the tailed arrows are localizations.
By the stratification axioms, all such squares are cartesian. Then the fact that
ea : CS > C is an equivalence is discussed, in almost exactly these terms, in
the proof of Proposition A.8.11].

In general, let x € P be the unique element of P\Pe<n-13 then x is a maximal
element. For convenience, we'll write Q for P<n—1. Observe that we have an
isomorphism of posets

nh: At x ((P™(Q))*) > P"(P)

given by
h(0,¢) = {P},
(le) = {{x}},
h(0,T) = T,
ACL, T) = {{2}} UT,

where c is the cone point.

Now C admits a stratification G’ along A! wherein

6'(1) = G({x}), 6'(0) = 6(Q),
so that
ga1:C8 =C
is an equivalence. On the other hand, G(Q) obviously inherits a stratification
6” along Q, and the functor
$0: G(Q)m + 6(2)

is an equivalence.
Here’s what we deduce by combining these two equivalences. Let

K = P™(A!) Ia: (P™(Q) x At)

where we’ve glued the edge {0} — {0,1} of P™(A!) to the edge {Q} x A? of
P(Q) x Al. Let € be the full subcategory Fun(K, C) spanned by those F for
which ,

Flpmary € Cy,

and

F lpm (Q)x{o} Flem(@)x (a3 © 6(Q)m «

Then evaluation on {A} € P(A?) induces an equivalence of categories
ea :63C.

But
pm(A!) = Al x Al,
/n/nand so

K & (At I} P™(Q)) x Al.
For any simplicial set S, the inclusion
Ally so $4
is inner anodyne, and so we get an inner anodyne composite
K > At x ((P"(Q))9) 4 PMP),

giving an equivalence of categories Fun(P” (P), C) ~ Fun(K, C), which restricts
to an equivalence of categories CS + C. Composing with ea: completes the
proof. im]

Proposition 3.27. For any P and any C stratified along P, the restriction
functor
Tm: CS 4Co_,
is an equivalence.
Proof. Let
km : C8_, > Fun(P™(P), C)

be the right Kan extension functor. We claim that C® is equal to the essential
image of Kim.
Indeed, let g be the unique element of P<m \P<m-—1. Suppose

TeEP™(P)\P™l(P).

Then T is of the form
{{p1}.--+ {pe}, PS}.

Let a: A3 + P™-!(P) be the functor with

ovr (0) = {{pi},-+> {pe}. {ab},
ar (1) = {{pr},-+> {pe}, P<m—1},
or (2) = {{pr},-+> {pe} fa}, P<m-—i}-

Then a is coinitial in P™~'(P)r,. Moreover, F : P™(P) > C is an object of
C§ if and only if
© Flpm—1(p) € CS_,, and
¢ for each T € P™(P)\P™-1(P), F(L) € G(P<m) and the maps
F(P) ~+ F(or(0)), F(®) + Flar(t))

are localizations.

26
/n/nBut by the stratification axiom, the latter condition is equivalent to the condi-
tion that the square

F(T) ——> Flar(0))

| |

F(ar(1)) —> F(ar(2))

be a pullback. This completes the proof. im

If n = |P|, we now have equivalences of categories CS 4 C (Proposition

3.26) and CS + CE & CS (inductively, using Proposition 8.27). This consi-
tutes a proof of Theorem

Example 3.28. When C is the category Sp° for a finite abelian group G, we
recover the statement of Theorem 3], though in substantially different
language.

Example 3.29. Suppose p is a prime and M = Oc,, so that P = Al. Then
Theorem 3.21] states, after unwinding the definition, that an object E of of
Mack(M) ~ Sp? is given by the following data:

e A spectrum with C,-action
E, € Gu ({{1}}) ~ Fun(BC,, Sp),
the underlying spectrum of E;

e a spectrum

Eo € Ga({{0}}) ~ Sp,

the Cp-geometric fixed point spectrum of E;

e and a map
Eq > Lo} Ei & Ey?

where (—)’@ is the Tate spectrum, defined by the cofiber sequence
(-)ne > (-)"6 > (J,
The epiorbital category F<? is visibly equivalent to Oc,, so an object
F € Mack(FS?) ~ Fun?°*“(Sp, Sp)
is given by the same data as an object of Sp, but in this case, E, and Ep are

interpreted as the second and first derivatives of F’, respectively. This classifi-
cation of 2-excisive functors was first carried out in §5].

27
/n/nWe'll close this section by saying a few words about what happens for infinite
posets. Let P be an infinite poset equipped with a system of finite subposets

0= Peo © Per +++ C Pen G++: CP

which is a threading in the sense that for each i, P<; is downwardly closed and
has cardinality 7, and

UP<n =P.

n

Definition 3.30. Suppose
0=CoCC1C---CO,C--:

is a sequence of stable oo-categories such that C,,_1 is a reflective stable sub-
category of C,, for all n. Suppose we have, for each n, a stratification G,, of C,,
along P<n, and that all of these are compatible in the sense that

Cr—1 = Gn(P<n-1)
and G,,_ is the induced stratification. Let
Cy := lim C,,
n

be the limit over the localization maps. We call this data a pro-stratification of
Cx along P.

Then it follows from the proof of Theorem that the diagram

Cn ae (Cn) —~—> Chr

of | |

commutes up to homotopy for every n. Taking the limit as n — oo gives an
equivalence
Cx > lim CS =: CS.
n
The limit C& can be described explicitly as follows. Let
P* = colim P(Pn).
n
and
C®™ := colim C,
n

(which differs from C., in that we have taken the colimit over the inclusions
rather than the limit over the localizations). Then C§& is the full subcategory
of Fun(P®, C~) spanned by those functors F' for which

Flecp,) © Cy".
Thus we have a description of C., in terms of (infinite) diagrams of maximally

local objects.

28
/n/nExample 3.31. With P as above, let C be a symmetric monoidal presentable
stable oo-category and let (Kp)pep be a collection of objects of C such that any
K,y-local object is Ky-acyclic unless p > q. Then letting

Cr = Ly K,C

PEP cy *P
gives a pro-stratification of
Co = Ly -p K,C
along P. In the case where P = N°P and K,, is the Morava K-theory K(n),

we have expressed the category of harmonic spectra in terms of diagrams of
K(n)-local spectra.

Example 3.32. Let
= Mo CM C++) CMn C+» CM = colim Mn
be a sequence of inclusions of EOCs giving rise to the threading
Po S Pi S++ OC Pa Sos:

on posets of isomorphism classes. Then M! is disjunctive and we may speak
of the category Mack(M,C) of additive functors from A*//(M") into some
stable target category C. Letting

C, = Mack(M,,, C)
gives a pro-stratification of Mack(M, C) along P.
Example has a couple of interesting special cases:

Example 3.33. Let M, = FS". Then M is the category F, of all finite sets
and surjective maps, and Mack(M, C) is equivalent to the category of functors
F : Sp > C which are weakly analytic in the sense that

F ~ lim P,F.
n

Example 3.34. Let G be a profinite group and let M be the category of finite
G-orbits. Then any threading of the poset P of isomorphism classes in M
gives a pro-stratification of Mack(M,C), which should be thought of a kind
of category of genuine G-objects in which only the fixed points under cofinite
subgroups are salient.

It’s worth noting that given a cofinal system of finite quotients (Hm)men of
G, we could choose our threading so that for each m, there is some nm such
that

Mam = OHm-:

Thus

Mack(M,C) ~ lim Mack(Oy,C).
GH, finite

29
/n/n4 K(n)-local theory

In this brief section, we’ll see that symmetry properties which emerge when one
works locally with respect to the Morava K-theories k(n) cause large chunks
of this theory to collapse. We'll reprove a result of Kuhn on the K(n)-local
splitting of Taylor towers, and give a new tom Dieck-like splitting result for
K(n)-local G-spectra.

The following “chromatic blueshift” theorem is a consequence of the results
of and [HS96); it appears in roughly this form in [HE13}, and as we shall
see, is also highly relevant.

Theorem 4.1. Let G be a finite group and let E be a K(n)-local spectrum
with G-action. Then the transfer map

N: Eyg 3 ES

is a K(n)-local equivalence. Thus the Tate spectrum E'¢ is K(n)-acyclic.

Theorem 4.2. If M is a epiorbital category and C is a stable oo-category such
that all Tate spectra are zero - for instance, the category of K(n)-local spectra
- then the comonad DR of Theorem [2.38] is the identity comonad, and so the
Taylor sequence functor

D : Mack(M,C) > Fun(M~,C)
is an equivalence.
Having got this far, the proof is fairly simple.

Proof. Let X be an object of M and let ix once again denote the full inclusion
ASS (Gx)  ASF(Mex), where Gx is the full subcategory of M spanned by
X. Let E € Fun(Gx,C). Then for any Y € Mex, the natural map

(ix) (EVV) > (ix) (EVV)

takes the form

ram) Enauts(x) ram) baat ;(X)

f€Map y4(X,Y)/isomorphism f€Map y4(X,Y)/isomorphism
and is thus an equivalence, by our hypothesis. We deduce that for each X € M,
LX ~ R*,

and so
L~R.

But DL ~ id (Proposition[2.37) and so DR ~ id. This completes the proof. O

/n/nCorollary 4.3. Any K(n)-local G-spectrum E (by which we mean a Mackey
functor valued in the K(n)-local category) satisfies a very strong tom Dieck
splitting property: we have an equivalence

BLY V LO/F pen,
H<G/conjugacy
In particular, for each H < G, we have a canonical decomposition
Bus V ((B°*)awunK)
(K<H)/conjugacy in G
where W(H, Kx) is the relative Weyl group, defined as
W(H,K) := (Ne(K)N H)/K.

Corollary 4.4 (Kuhn). Let F : Sp — Sp be an m-excisive functor taking
values in A(n)-local spectra. Then the Taylor tower for F splits: we have an

equivalence

A The free semiadditive oo-category on a group

This appendix is devoted to proving Theorem[2.27] which we restate here (with
slightly different notation) for convenience:

Theorem A.1. Let G be an (ordinary) groupoid. Then A°//(G") is the free
semiadditive oo-category on G: for any semiadditive oo-category C, the natural
inclusion induces an equivalence of categories

Fun® (A°/(G"), C) > Fun(G, C).
First, we note that we may assume G is connected. Indeed, having proved

this, the general case will follow from the fact that if (M,)iey is an I-indexed
family of orbital categories, then

i
At (U1 m) ~@Batt(mM?).
I I

We will further assume that our connected groupoid has only one object, and
denote the corresponding group, too, by G.

Now let’s get some notation out of the way. Let F, be the category of finite
pointed sets. If S € F,, denote by S° the finite set S \ {*}. If s € S°, denote
by xs : S > {s}, the characteristic map at s:

vlio={? t=s

* otherwise.

31
/n/nDefinition A.2. Remark 2.4.2.2] Let C be an oo-category which
admits finite products. Recall that by definition, the category CMon(C) of
commutative monoids in C is the full subcategory of Fun(F,,C) spanned by
those functors F’ satisfying the Segal condition: for each S € F,, the edges
F(S) > F({s}4) determine an equivalence

F(8)~ J] F({s}4).
ses?

We'll abbreviate CMon(Top) to CMon.

Now let’s begin the proof. First we note that G™ is equivalent to the category
Fr of finite sets with free G-action.

Definition A.3. Let L(G) be the Lawvere theory of commutative monoids
with G-action: the full subcategory of Fun(G,CMon), which is equivalent to
CMon(Fun(G, Top)), spanned by the the essential image of F C Top under
the left adjoint of the forgetful functor Fun(G,CMon) > Top.

Theorem A.4. There is an equivalence of categories between A°!S(Fr©) and

L(G).

Proof. First let’s construct the functor. Fun(G,CMon) is a certain full subcat-
egory of Fun(G x F,, Top), so we can do this by constructing a functor

ASS (Fr?) x Gx F, + Top

adjointing over, and checking it makes sense on objects.
We'll do the construction in two stages. First, note that we have a functor

ATF Fr®) x ALT (F) + AST (Fr?)

simply by taking objectwise products of staircase diagrams. We also have an
inclusion 7: F,. > Aclf(F) as follows: an n-simplex of F,, given by a chain of
pointed maps

X 4x, 8...5x,
maps to the staircase diagram (Aj; )o<i<j<n with
Au = X? i<j
Aij = (fifj-ace fig) 1X? 1 Fj.

Functoriality is easily checked, as is the fact that all squares which ought to be
pullbacks are pullbacks. Composing these two and multiplying by G, we get a
map

pw: ATT (Fr?) x Gx Fy + AS (Fr®) x G.
Next, we'll define a functor A°!(Fr°) xG — Top by defining a left fibration

Kt ASS (Fro) xG> Acll (Fr?) xG.

32
/n/nHere A°!S(Fr@),. x G is itself the total space of a cocartesian fibration over G.
A vertex of A°ff(Fr°), x G is a free G-set U together with a finite set S and
a map of sets S > U. An edge of A°//(Fr@), «x G with source a, : $; > Ui
and target a2 : Sy — U2 is an element g € G together with a diagram

S, —— So

[oom 1 I

U, <— W]e

U2

with higher simplices defined analogously. We define « to be the map that
forgets S. To prove that x is a left fibration, define A°‘!(Fr@), to be the fiber
of Acff(Fr°), « G over the vertex of G. « restricts to a map

ASS (Fro), + AS (Fr?)
which is actually isomorphic to the target map
t: AST (Fr Gy > AclS (Fr@)

which is definitely a left fibration. Together with the fact that the preimage
under « of an edge of G is an equivalence, this implies that x itself is a left
fibration.

Let K be a functor A°f!(Fr°) x G + Top that classifies k. We now have
a well-defined functor

ao : ASS (Fr) > Fun(G x F,, Top)

defined by composing ys with K and then taking adjoints. For each free finite
G-set U, we must show that the functor

F, x {U} 4 Al! (Fr?) — Fun(G, Top)

is a commutative monoid. Unwinding the definitions shows that this is a con-
sequence of the fact that K preserves products. Moreover, one identifies o(U)
with

mr",
where © = [],,59 2n and G acts by permutation on the factors. This is equiv-
alent to the free commutative monoid in Fun(G, Top) on the set U/G. So o
factors through a functor

a: ASI(Fr?) > L(G).

From here, showing that a is an equivalence is the easy part. Essential
surjectivity is obvious. For full faithfulness, it suffices to show that a induces
an equivalence

a9 : Mapgers(pre)(G, G) > Mapyiq)(=*9,5*9)

33
/n/nsince all of the other relevant maps are products of some copies of this one.

Since G is a commutative monoid in A°/!(Fr¢) and D* is a commutative
monoid in £(G), ao underlies a map of commutative monoids, both of which are
easily seen to be equivalent as commutative monoids to ©*°. Thus it’s enough
to check that ag takes a set of free generators to a set of free generators. On
the left, we may take this set to be

/X,

where ry is right multiplication by g. On the other hand, we may take our set
of generators on the right to be those automorphisms of ©*© induced by right
multiplication by elements of g. Tracing through the definitions a final time,
we see that ao maps the one set of generators to the other. This completes the
proof. im]

g€G

We have the functor G > ASS (Fr) that takes, for example, a 2-simplex
(g,h) to the diagram

/<,
RA NZ NG

We have the composite
igi Gx Fe 3 ALS (Fr®) x ALS (F) 4 AST (Fr),

Proposition A.5. ig is the universal commutative monoid with G-action,
which is to say the initial functor satisfying the Segal condition from G' x F, to
a category with finite products.

Proof. First we must show that ig is indeed a commutative monoid. G doesn’t
make any difference here; we just need to show that i: F, > A°!(F) satisfies
the Segal condition. This follows from the fact that the image of the inert map
xj : (n) > (1) is the span

a
“iN
i i

Now let U(G) be the universal category supporting a commutative monoid
with G-action. Since U(G) is the initial category under G x F,, that takes certain

34
/n/ndiagrams to limit diagrams, Proposition 5.3.6.2 of gives a prescription
for building it as the opposite of a full subcategory of a certain localization
S~1Psh((G x F.)°?) of the presheaf category Psh((G x F,)°P). Since we’re in
this business, let’s let Y : (G x F,)°? > Psh((G x F,)°?) denote the Yoneda
embedding.

In this case, the localization S is generated by the morphisms

TI ¥()) + Vin)
(nye

given by precomposition with the inert maps, and so localization is “Segalifi-
cation” and the local objects are exactly the commutative monoid spaces with
G-action. Thus U(G)°? is the full subcategory of Fun(F, x G, Top) spanned by
the Segalifications of

IT ¥c)

(nye

as n varies. But Y((1)) is, by definition, left Kan extended along the inclusion
(l):* 9 F.xG

and so its Segalification is the free commutative monoid with G-action on one
generator. Since Segalification preserves coproducts, the other objects follow.
Now we've given an equivalence between U(G)°? and L(G), and therefore
Acff(Fr¢). We know that this category is canonically self-opposite, so we might
as well forget the op on U(G). Let’s show that this equivalence comes from ig.
Since A°Sf(Fr@) is semiadditive, specifying a commutative monoid with G-
action BG x F, + A°s(Fr) is equivalent to specifying it on G x (1) (see
Corollary 2.4.3.10 of [Lur12]). Both ig and the universal commutative monoid
in U(G) take Gx (1) to the G-set G with its right action on itself. This completes
the proof. im]

Corollary A.6. Let C be an oo-category with finite products. Then pullback
along ig gives an equivalence

Fun™ (A°/ (Fr@), C) + CMon(Fun(G, C)).
Proof. This is just a restatement of [A.5] o
We deduce TheoremP.27Jas the special case of [A.6]where C is semiadditive.

B_ The proof of Lemma 2.36]

Lemma B.1. Let C be an oo-category, z : D — C the inclusion of a full
subcategory and X € C an object. Let « denote the join of simplicial sets, and
/n/nlet
ig : A° > Ax (A" x At)
i, : A" x {0} > A°* (A" x AY)
in: A" x {1} > AP x (A" x Al)

be the natural inclusions. We define a simplicial set Cx/p,/ whose n-simplices
are maps a: A° x (A" x A!) > C with

aoip =X, aot, € Fun(A",D).

Then the map p2 : Cx/p/; — C coming from precomposition with iz is cocarte-
sian, and its cocartesian edges are those a for which the image of ao 7 is an
equivalence. Moreover, the inclusion

A: Cx; xcD@ Cx /p;

formed by precomposition with the collapse map A° x (A" x At) + A° x A” is
coinitial, and therefore left anodyne Proposition 4.1.1.3].

Proof. First we show that any edge a for which a o 7; is an equivalence is
cocartesian. This is the claim that any commutative diagram of the form

T2
7
T; —— > T;

/ W:
\IZ7\

WwW, ———> W3

X

with T; + T> an equivalence can be completed to a diagram from A° x (A? x
A’), which is clear by inspection. Since there are plenty of these edges, po is
cocartesian.

Now we tackle the coinitiality claim. In fact, we’ll show that \ admits a
right adjoint, which suffices. Let A + A! be the cocartesian fibration classified
by A; an n-simplex of A is a map 7: A” > A! together with a map

a: (A° x {(i,j) € A” x Al |j =Oorier '(1)}) 9C
We wish to show that a is also cartesian. In fact, we claim that an edge

To — Ts

/

W3

36
/n/nof A over the nondegenerate edge of A? is cartesian if Tz > T3 is an equivalence.
This is the claim that any commuting diagram of the form

W3

can be extended to a commuting diagram of the form

Ws,
which, again, is clear. Oo
We list some formal consequences of Lemma
Corollary B.2. Let CU, bea fibrant replacement for Cx/p, in the covariant
model structure over C, so that C
object W € C, the map

Top

x/D/ > C is a left fibration and for each

(CYB )w > (Cx/p/)w

is a Kan-Quillen weak equivalence. Then the functor classified by Cu / is
equivalent to the restriction and left Kan extension z1z*Map(X, —) of the functor
corepresented by X.

Now let 8: Cx/p; — Cx, be given on n-simplices by precomposition with

ig * ig : AO x A" > AP x (A” x A),

Since Cx, is a left fibration, we have a commutative diagram

B
Cx; xe D ——_—___> Cx,

bo
/n/nIt follows that the counit map cx : z1z*Map(X,—) > Map(X, —) is given, after
unstraightening, by 6’.

Lemma B.3. Let W € C and let f : X — W be a morphism in C. Then the
homotopy fiber of

ex,w : (212z*Map(X, —))w + Map(X, W)

over f is given, up to weak equivalence, by the simplicial set Ow,¢ whose n-
simplices are maps Z : A"+? — C such that

© Zl atont2) = f, and
e for each i with 0 <i<n+2, Z(i)€D.

Proof. We know that the Joyal model structure is self-enriched, by using
Corollary 2.2.5.4] to deduce that the pushout-product of a trivial cofibration
with a cofibration is a trivial cofibration, and it follows that if K — L is any cofi-
bration of simplicial sets and E is a quasicategory, then Fun(L, E) > Fun(K, E)
is a categorical fibration. Since § is formed from such a fibration by pullback,
6 is also a categorical fibration.

The value of cx on W is given, up to weak equivalence, by the map

Bw : (Cxp/)w > (Cx/)w = Hom" (X,W).

Since the target of Bw is a Kan complex and fw is a categorical fibration, it is a
cocartesian fibration Proposition 3.3.18], and since a fibrant replacement
for By in the covariant model structure over Hom’(X,W) is automatically a
Kan fibration, the fibers of Sw are its homotopy fibers.

By definition, the fiber Bw,f over f € Hom*(X, W) is the simplicial set
whose n-simplices are maps Z’ : (A° * (A" x A!))/(A" x {1}) > C such that

e Zoi, CD, and

e the (n + 1)-simplex Z’ o (ip * iz) is the image of f under the rightmost
degeneracy; that is, it is the totally degenerate n-simplex of Cx, at f.

In other words, an n-simplex of Gy, is a map

Z" : A x ((A" x Al)/(A” x {1}))
with Z’(A" x {0}) € D, and Z”(A° *((A” x {1})/(A” x {1})) = f. From here,
the proof that bw, ~ Ow, is a minor variant of the proof of Proposition
4.2.1.5]. Oo

We now immerse ourselves in the notation of Lemma[2.36] which we restate
here for convenience.

38
/n/nLemma B.4. Let M be an epiorbital category, NV a downwardly closed sub-
category of M and T its upwardly closed complement. Denote the restriction
AcfF(ir)* and the left Kan extension A‘! (iz); respectively by II7 and 7, and
similarly denote A°f!(jy7)* and AY! (jy): by BY and &¥ respectively. Then
there’s a cofiber sequence of functors Mack(M,CMon) - Mack(M,CMon)

ri’ 41a Vor,
where € and 7) are the counit and unit of their respective adjunctions.

Proof. Since all of the functors in this sequence are colimit-preserving, it suffices
to check that its value on each corepresentable Mackey functor is a cofiber
sequence. Let X € A*ff(M) be an object and let f : X — Y > W bea
morphism in A°/‘(M). We'll analyze the fiber Uw,y of Lemma B.3]

For C an co-category, let Oc be the twisted arrow category of C (see
§2]) and let OF := O8 be its opposite. Then an n-simplex of Uw.s is by
definition a functor ania

0:0 > ME

such the span
0(0, 0) — 0(0,n + 2) > o(n + 2,n +2)

coincides with f and g(i,i) € T™ for all i with 0 <i<n+2. By the upward
closedness of T, the latter condition implices that o(i,j7) € T™ for all (i,j) 4
(0,0), (n+ 2,n+ 2), and in particular Uw,p is empty unless Y € J". We claim
that if Y € T", then Uy, is contractible. In fact, let Tw, be the subsimplicial
set of Ow, whose n-simplices are those which factor through the morphism

(0,0) if (i, 7) = (0,0)
7:04" -, 6a"? Vi, j) = 4 (n$2,n 42) if (i,j) =(n+2,n +42)
(0,n + 2) otherwise.

If Y € T", then clearly Tw.s = *, and we claim that Ty,, is a simplicial
deformation retract of Ow,s. We'll do this in two stages as follows. For each
a*? _, 04" be defined by

integer k, let yf : O
vk (3) = (main(i — k, 0), 3)
and dually, define yf : oa" 5 oar? by
re (i, 3) = (i, max(j + k,n +2).
Let ly. f be the subsimplicial set of Ow, whose n-simplices factor through
ea and define Tier similarly; we will show that each of Twp and Tip isa
simplicial deformation retract of Uw,r, and since

Dwr =P OTs

39
/n/nthis will complete the proof of the claim. We will prove the result for Ting the
result for Tw is, of course, entirely dual.
For each n,l with 0 <1 <n+1, let tr. : A" + A! be the unique map with

7,1 (0) = [0,--+,n—J),

nl

where we interpret [0,—1] as the empty interval. Then we define a map

0: Uw, x Al > Uws

on n-simplices by

Then ©, is a retraction onto ry.
What we have proved so far is that

(0,7nu) > 007%.

; so we have the required simplicial homotopy.

€cy ? TTI cx > cx,

after evaluation on an object W, is homotopic to the inclusion of the connected
components of Map(X,W) comprising those maps f : X « Y > W with
Y € A*ff(T). What’s left is easy: n-,(W) is the natural map

Map gers uy (X,W) > Mapgers yy (J(X), 3(W)),

which is just the projection away from the image of €.,(W). This concludes

the proof of Lemma [2.36] Oo
